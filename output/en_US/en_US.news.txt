What most interested reviewers and readers was the way I recreated daily life in the Warsaw ghetto and my references to Jewish mysticism — to kabbalah. For instance, the high school kids I spoke to in Warsaw were very curious about my choice of a ghost — an "ibbur" — as the narrator of the book, and also about his use of anagrams. Readers did sometimes express one concern, however: that my portrayal of Poles may have been too negative. In "The Warsaw Anagrams," the narrator, Erik Cohen, is denounced by Polish Christian neighbors while in hiding and taken to a labor camp. Unfortunately, it was a fate that awaited many Jews in hiding. And yet the majority of Poles I spoke to seemed to truly believe that most of their parents and grandparents did their very best to protect their Jewish neighbors, which just isn't true. The most reliable estimates are that about five percent of the Polish population — one person in 20 — came to the aid of the country's Jews.

Decades ago, Baltimore County was divided into 15 election districts. They no longer have any real function in elections, but they remain the basis for apportionment of liquor licenses. In general, one "on-sale" license — that is, a bar or restaurant license — may be issued for every 2,500 people. Randallstown is the only part of the county that is undersubscribed when it comes to licenses, and because of grandfathering, one district, on the county's east side, is vastly oversubscribed. The Dundalk area, by population, should have about 42 licenses, but it actually has 125. Licenses can be bought and sold within a district (provided that the county liquor board approves of the new owner), but they cannot be sold across district lines without a special dispensation from the General Assembly, which controls county liquor laws.

Before the spill, the parish slashed its budget by 11 percent, cutting garbage collection, the fire department and mosquito control. There was just no money.

Back in 2006, Elvira Arellano, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was convicted of Social Security fraud, took sanctuary in a Chicago storefront church with her U.S.-born 7-year-old son for a year to avoid being deported.

This led to her supporters calling her a Mexican Rosa Parks - and people of all races and ethnicities across the country were infuriated.

Fortunately, those dishes don't come very often, and there's never a misfire on desserts. Rulli creates more than a dozen each night. When the trilogy of chocolate ($8) was placed before a friend who didn't know the background of the restaurant, she asked who did the desserts, because "you can really see the passion in them." The plate contained an on-point rendition of molten chocolate cake, a rich candy-bar-like rectangle with a thin crisp crust, and a demitasse of rich hot chocolate.

The Lyon B-25 was not on the raid – none of those planes came back and none were intended to, an important part of the story. Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle and 79 other fliers took off from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Hornet knowing they didn't have fuel to make it back. These were lumbering, land-based bombers stripped of as much surplus weight as possible. Neither before nor since has anything like that been attempted.
Supporters of the tax face many of the same obstacles as last year. The corruption investigation continues. The economy remains sluggish. And MetroHealth -- once the darling of tax campaigns, featured on fliers and in a kickoff news conference -- is again under fire.

What a joy it was to drive with my birding buddy Jeff Wert into Holmes County on Sunday and to almost immediately find a tree swallow perched on a utility wire, its white breast glowing in the first light of morning.

In a December lease agreement, the county spells out minimum benchmarks for its private partner, requiring Chicago-based MMPI to host 43 exhibit hall events and 72 meetings or banquets in other parts of the facility. By its seventh year, the convention center must be 35 percent occupied, bring in 214,500 attendees (in- or out-of-town) and generate 33,000 hotel room stays. By MMPI's calculations, that could mean $708 million a year in total impact.

My point - and let me be very clear in making it - is not that Perkins has chosen the wrong economic model for Jesus. I'm not joining the fray to say, "You're wrong - Jesus is not a free marketer, he's a socialist!" It's also not to say that our earthy concerns about wealth and poverty and debt and justice and daily bread do not matter to Jesus. I believe they do. But when we take his teachings and reduce them down to nothing but a party line, we diminish the scope of what God is doing in the world. We stop praying, working and looking for the redemption and reconciliation of the world, and instead we huddle over our tiny pile of minas - or demand them from someone else. In either case, we have impoverished ourselves and the message we carry.

Such an observation is telling, both because of what it means for Willis ("It was seeing Janis Joplin," she admits, "that made me resolve, once and for all, not to get my hair straightened") and because by sharing it, she opens herself, and us, to Joplin's vulnerability. "After the split with Big Brother," she writes, "Janis retrenched considerably, perhaps because she simply couldn't maintain that level of intensity, perhaps for other reasons that would have become clear if she had lived. My uncertainty on this point makes me hesitate to be too dogmatic about my conviction that leaving Big Brother was a mistake."

If teenagers want to watch a movie, they'll watch the movie. I don't think there will be fewer because it's rated R. If fewer people see "Bully," it will be because most teenagers are more interested in seeing a blockbuster than a documentary.
There is a strong sense that there is a desire to move our students that are flying at a high altitude to a higher altitude, so what strategies do we want to put in place, or what systems are in place to make sure we're doing that, while at the same time, eliminating any achievement gaps that might exist, whether it be a demographic or service achievement gap. There's also, from my understanding, a need for some technology enhancements.
Outgoing BPU head Lee Solomon said that he knew the public had a thirst to see some of the power companies called out, but said the board must not express firm opinions that could threaten its integrity when quasi-judicial rate cases come up in the future.
Romney pronounced himself appalled, accusing Obama of having "railed against arguments no one is making" and "criticized policies no one is proposing." Yet Romney could neither defend the cuts nor deny the president's list of particulars, based as they were on reasonable assumptions. And when Obama went after the right's willingness to use the power of the Supreme Court for ideological purposes, conservatives were aghast - and never mind that conservatives have been castigating activist judges since at least the 1968 presidential campaign.

"The Dictator": You basically need to know three things about this comedy: 1) It stars Sacha Baron Cohen and is helmed by Larry Charles, the pair who unleashed the outrageousness of "Borat" upon the world; 2) It's about the title despot, who has a Gadhafi-esque penchant for grandiose uniforms and enough money to win actress Megan Fox (who's shown in the preview complaining of his gift of a ruby, "What am I, a Kardashian?"); 3) Cohen appeared in costume at the Oscars and disrupted the smiling and posing by dumping Kim Jong-Il's "ashes" on Ryan Seacrest. Still not offended? Then you're probably going to love it. (May 16)

"NASA ignored the intent of Congress and the interests of taxpayers," Brown said in a press statement. "NASA was directed to consider regional diversity when determining shuttle locations. Unfortunately, it looks like regional diversity amounts to which coast you are on, or which exit you use on I-95.

Steen probably is right. If anyone thought the Blues would cruise by San Jose without encountering much resistance, they were in for a rude face-wash on Thursday night. The Sharks' players collectively have competed in more than 1,000 NHL postseason games, and this could be their last stand. They won't go quietly. They're desperate.

There's nothing wildly distinctive about the Pilates mat work. It's just your basic moves — the Pilates 100, roll-ups, single-leg stretches, etc. — demonstrated with several modifications, including a neck pillow, chair and different leg positions. The qi gong exercises may be a radical departure for some, as they incorporate hip-loosening movement with self-massage of legs, arms and back. The Pilates arm and leg segments are somewhat difficult if they're not modified but are interspersed with yoga stretches and forward bends to provide relief to back and muscles.

"Las Vegas is just more colors, more textures, more people doing things to entertain you with illusion or whatever their capacity is," he said. "One of the things I admire most in Las Vegas is the quality of service that people do present. With all respect to New York, I see more people in Las Vegas being present, in the moment, with a genuine smile, saying, 'Hi, welcome. What would you like to have? It's my pleasure to serve you.' And they really mean it. They're not looking far away wishing they were somewhere else."

Not far from the Terminal Tower was radio station WJW, where my father, DJ Alan Freed, aired his nightly "Moondog Show" from 11:15 p.m. till 2 a.m., filling the night time air with what was known variously as blues and rhythm, or "race" records. Back in 1952, he was the only white disc jockey playing music created by blacks on a white-owned station.
Idaho had a 16-4 rebounding edge before a putback by Burton – he and Nelson were arguably the only Beavers playing at their usual energy level – gave the Beavers an apparent spark and cut the lead to 18-11.

"Wow," Strawberry said when asked how he reacted. "It's kind of shocking, but Mo's a little older now and when I played he was still doing the same thing, shagging fly balls, running into walls, but he was younger then. So when you get a little older, you got to be a little cautious about things.

Is there a better symbol of willed American decline? The pity is not Discovery's retirement -- beautiful as it was, the shuttle proved too expensive and risky to operate -- but that it died without a successor. The planned follow-on -- the Constellation rocket-capsule program to take humans back into orbit and from there to the moon -- was suddenly canceled in 2010. And with that, control of manned spaceflight was gratuitously ceded to Russia and China.
“Hand to God” gets a little heavy-handed when it tries to dig deeper, especially in Tyrone’s climactic lecture on morality. But its sharp-eyed satire transcends zaniness. And you’ll never look at a hand puppet quite the same way again.

I've only touched the surface about the story. The hardships some of the performers endure during other parts of their daily lives are also reflected in the piece. There was a saying we used to have in the Air Force (and all branches of the military), affixed to many barracks walls: it was "Kwitcherdambellyakin". Most of us here have nothing about which to "belly ache". If you think you do, try to watch the Kinshasa Symphony piece on the 60 MINUTES website, and see how fellow human beings with all the problems in the world have found a way to be as happy as any people have ever been. That happiness, as I hope you'll see, resonates not only from their smiles and first-class performances, but also from the obvious joy of knowing they've truly accomplished something very significant, for themselves and those blessed enough to hear them perform. They definitely personnify all people can be and achieve...when given the chance to do so.

Efforts to uncover failings in the program have not fared much better in the Senate. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who chairs the Judiciary Committee, has done little more than write letters that appear to be an attempt to somehow balance a political ledger.

Bush's administration.

I hope 'Working on a Dream' has caught the energy of the band fresh off the road from some of the most exciting shows we've ever done.

In Cleveland, more than 3,700 of 6,184 kits going back to 1991 had not been tested as of 2009. In a decision left largely up to detectives, evidence often was not sent in cases in which victims declined to prosecute, there were no leads or there wasn't going to be a trial.
Maybe I'm gullible, but I don't think they are acting. It's certainly much more interesting if they're not, because if their agitation is real, it says something about the actor mentality, something partly endearing and partly disturbing. It suggests a childlike vulnerability (that's the endearing part) combined with an ego hunger so big it's willing to devour anything, even the obvious equivalent of junk food, in a fruitless and never-ending pursuit of psychological nourishment. With that in mind, one can view the stars sitting in that ballroom as a collection of collagen-injected piranhas, floating in a

There's pleasure to be found in the resolute offbeatness of "Henry's Crime." It's nearly as concerned with the play as it is with the heist (and with drawing parallels between the two). And the relentless Buffalo gloom is a strange counterpoint to the mostly light character interplay and quirky-indie score; Reeves' blankness is generally well-used here, and Caan's character is amusing for really not caring if he goes back to prison or not.
Measure B's supporters offer nothing but more empty promises. They say Measure B would help protect our families from lung disease and death caused by the nation's worst air pollution. It's true that L.A. has the nation's worst air, but Measure B would not close any of the DWP's out-of-state coal-burning power plants. It wouldn't even meet the growing power demands caused by over-building and digital billboards.

Set the bowl or pan over - not touching - hot or barely simmering water in a saucepan or the bottom pan of the double boiler. Whisk continuously until warm and just beginning to thicken, about 1 minute. Add the butter one piece at a time, whisking until absorbed before adding more.

Spoon hollandaise sauce over the bottom half of the spears and sprinkle with parsley and zest.
These entrepreneurs are part of what Portland State University professor Charles Heying describes as the "artisan economy," a movement capitalizing on growing consumer demand for local and unique products -- demand couched in part as a rejection of national chains and globalization. Highly specialized artisan entrepreneurs manufacture, produce and sell products that tell a unique local story and, most importantly, create difficult-to-export local jobs.

It would be dumb for the state to take guns away from the police, but the truth is, law abiding citizens need firearms for the same reason cops do.

Last year, the national conference of the National Beer Wholesalers Association was "more angst-fest than beer-fest," in the words of one Wall Street analyst.

Your honor, our lives have been shattered and there is nothing that this Court can do that could ever make us whole again. Every single day of our lives there will be a hole in our hearts and in our lives where Rusty should be. We all still reach for the phone to call him. We still expect to see him, Sophia and Ian on Skype, especially on Sundays when we visit with my parents. Today, the pain of that void is almost unbearable. We hope in time it might diminish some, but it will never go away completely. Instead, we look to this Court to provide us with some small measure of comfort in knowing that this man, lawfully convicted of killing Rusty Sneiderman, will never walk among us again. We need to know that he will be confined to prison for the remainder of his days, forced to confront the hurt and devastation he has caused to so many. We ask you to show him the same mercy he showed Rusty and punish him in the only appropriate manner – LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE.

Dear Need: You sound so oddly detached from each other. I think she needs to hear specifically how you feel --- not in the form of blame, or a "hug me" plea that could come off as more needy than honest, but instead as a plain statement of how close to the edge you really are.

There are pieces on aging and bald spots; the book opens with two riffs on memory loss. They're not terrible, but they feel rattled off, as if Arianna Huffington (indeed, "The D Word," one of the book's original pieces, kicked off a new Huffington Post section on divorce) or some other big-name editor had said, "Whatever you want to write, I'm sure it will be great" and Ephron, in between, one hopes, screenplays and other facets of her very busy life, said, "Sure, here's 800 words." Eight hundred words that may be better than the average — heck, most any — blogger could conjure. But you're not any blogger. You're Nora Ephron.

Looking for a meatless entree, I could have ordered the broiled orange roughy ($14.95) with sauteed mixed vegetables. Not being a roughy fan, I picked the crab cakes marinara ($9.95). The two cakes are sauteed until brown and have a light texture and sweetness and little hint of fillers. They were heavily topped with that ubiquitous marinara sauce, which pretty much drowned out the flavor of the delicate crab. Again, a little less would have been better. A generous side of linguine with marinara goes with the crab cakes.

Can you call it a Ladies Night if there's a $500 bikini bull-ride contest involved? Probably not, which might be why this country bar ended them this summer. Still, the free drinks for women from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. (and for guys from 9 to 11 p.m.) make it worth the trip. And the bull's still there — just keep your clothes on for now, please.

2010 Testarossa Dos Rubios Vineyard Santa Lucia Highlands Chardonnay ($39; 14.1%): The inaugural release of the Don Rubios bottling is rich and ripe, but balanced; well-behaved and showing some elegance for its age.

I just read somewhere that a substantial slice of the population believes that our human ancestors lived among the dinosaurs, like on "The Flintstones." And 44 percent think evolution is a lot of hooey; they think people were created 10,000 years ago and haven't changed much since. So how much do you suppose the average shopper understands about the nature of direct-injection-molded polyurethane foam soles? How clearly could he or she explain the differences between PU soles and laminated EVA soles, and how each differs from Neoprene soles?

That Paterno's departure is similar but in ways much more sinister than those of other coaching icons, including Woody Hayes at Ohio State for slugging a Clemson player during a bowl game and Indiana basketball legend Bob Knight for assaulting a student on the Bloomington campus, shows only that he is capable of a lapse of judgment, according to Johnson.

• Brian Christopher, Special to the Seattle Times: Marquette edges Washington 79-77 on late three-pointer: The Huskies (4-3) were left lamenting a disparity in free-throw shooting (Marquette was 19 of 27; UW 5 of 10), 16 turnovers, poor transition defense and, in the end, a busted defensive assignment that allowed Crowder an open shot for the winner.

The bipartisan deficit reduction commission co-chaired by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson said the same thing: "Though reducing the deficit will require shared sacrifice, those of us who are best off will need to contribute the most.

A major theme of the film is deaf pride. Brodski doesn’t refer to herself as someone who "can’t" hear, but rather as someone who "doesn’t." She doesn’t object to hearing-enabling Cochlear implants but worries that new technology will threaten the vibrant deaf culture.
The results way back then were similar to those we have all experienced — at least those of us who have ever used film. “One man,” Fisher recorded, “had purchased film for 100 exposures and had gone on a long and interesting trip through Europe, kodaking as he went. After the film had been returned, as the custom was then, to the factory and developed, the pictures turned out spotty and spoiled as a result of the deterioration of the film’s emulsion.”

The state allows hunting of a certain number of black bears in the fall, but hunters are required to have licenses and register their kills with the state. California prohibits anyone from buying or selling bear parts, even if they are imported from other areas. Peddling bear parts is illegal in 34 states, including California, but they are highly prized in Asian markets.

Kathy Ponting, who leads the Fish and Game unit that investigates illegal commercialization of wildlife.

"All I can do is go off what I see, and I don't think that's the truth. So we've got to find a way to score on him. Our best rebounds and opportunities off second shots -- he catches everything, so we've got to keep it away from his glove. But I don't think we can tell our guys to stop shooting. But I think we've got to keep getting to the net as hard as we can. I'd like us to play the same way we did last game, with the exception of the two plays, one in our own zone and one off the rush. Just play that way."
The Wilson High version of "Ablaze" is something different, though. While retaining the same narrative premise, Zrebski rewrote and expanded it from a drama with a cast of eight to a musical with a cast of 23. Apart from a few rhythmically spoken passages, it's all sung, with only percussion for accompaniment. "For all intents and purposes, it's an opera," Zrebski says. "And a very strange opera -- it's not very linear."

The producers did their homework. A piece on how right-wing radio talk show hosts like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh sell their endorsements and editorial air time off to the highest bidders gained tremendous credibility from the videotaped segments the producers found of both Beck and Limbaugh shamelessly whoring themselves out on air. And there are no other words for their behavior. Good job by "Countdown" in exposing it.

"He means a lot to our team," Colaiacovo said. "He plays a lot of minutes, he plays in a lot of situations. He's a guy who can be a game-changer. (But) if he's out, we can't just fold up tent and say it's over. We'll miss him, but we've got to find ways to fill his void."

That might even be Windows Phone's defining concept. Again, you might not agree with this idea. The iPhone, and Android phones, just extend the standard PC metaphor into handheld devices. Wake the computer up, go to the Desktop, launch an app, spend some time inside that app's exclusive space, and then either put the computer back to sleep or move to a different app.

It is an original Peggy Fleming. An amateur art critic who remembers and reveres Peggy Fleming's artistry on the ice (gold medal, 1968 Olympics) would probably describe the painting, politely, as -- well, interesting if perhaps a tad primitive, but primitive in a nice, honest way.

A: It's not actively for sale but we're always talking about selling the farm. People think you have a farm and you live there forever. I grew up in a family and we moved a lot. It's more amazing to me that we've been here 20 years. If the kids aren't interested in the farm and I've done my thing with it, then that's a discussion that comes up from time to time.

“I’ve rarely heard veterans use the word ‘hero,’ and never in relation to themselves. Veterans don’t really talk about their combat experiences much — they talk about it with each other, or perhaps during therapy, but it’s not something they often speak of. And in a way I wish they would.”

The first two Harry Potter movies lulled our expectations into a trance. Although they were pretty and profitable, they were overly long, literal and loaded down with exposition. For all their flash, what they lacked was magic.
I LOVE that reaction. Not the name-calling. The passion. Freedom of expression is critical to our communities, to our country, to this newspaper.
Fears of a dramatic downturn in China, and the domino effect that would have throughout the region, have mostly receded. But it's clear that most central banks in Asia-Pacific remain concerned that growth could slow further. The Reserve Bank of Australia this week slashed its policy rate by half a percentage point, wary of slowing Chinese growth.

Bozeman, Mont., is farther away -- about an hour and a half drive from the north entrance to Yellowstone -- but has plenty of hotel rooms and a major airport.

Luckily, employers in greater numbers realize that diversity is strength. Many industries which rely on a skilled work force have expressed their ongoing struggle to find qualified applicants, despite the recession. These employers increasingly recognize that missing out on the talents and skills of half the work force simply doesn't make economic sense. They are looking for solutions to successfully recruit and advance more women in these jobs.

OK, what women need to understand is that men don't communicate. It's not intentional or on purpose. We're just not as emotional. You ladies feel like you have to express yourselves. We go silent and it gets misconstrued. You want to say, ‘Baby, today was a great day. Let me take two hours to tell you every detail.' We want to hear every detail in about five minutes. ... Basically, as men we don't understand the feedback women need. Sometimes you ladies cry, "You're selfish! It's all about you." We're not selfish. We just don't give you feedback, but we still love you.
Known for his scientific, methodical ways, the American rarely raises his voice and shows little emotion on the sidelines.

Take the Great Ocean Road about 70 miles west out of Melbourne and you'll hit Torquay. A road to the south eventually cuts across what used to be Mrs. Bell's farm. From parking spots above a bluff, a staircase leads down to a cove-shaped stretch of sand that is Bells Beach, the most legendary surf spot on the continent. It's celebrated as the birthplace of professional surfing, at least in Australia. Bells claims to have the world's oldest continuous pro surfing contest, going back to 1961. Part of the appeal, and the challenge, of Bells is that it's the flip side of the Gold Coast. Getting there and staying there is a chore. But it's one that feels more special than the Gold Coast (for Southern Californians, it's like the difference between Huntington Beach and Trestles). The down side is that you can make the trip all the way out to Bells and hit a day when the surf isn't up to par and the contest is off. It's a long way back to the city. I checked it out on a drive along the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's best scenic drives – Australia's version of Highway 1, except with kangaroos.
A new book, "Pantone: The 20th Century in Color" (Chronicle Books), looks at how color and cultural history affect each other, and find their way into our homes.

Dr. Andrew Bourne seemed to have it all: A loving family, a successful surgical practice in Mammoth Lakes, a mountain home where he could ski with friends or plunge into the wild with his dog, Oreo.

Kitty Zoeter said her death was a great loss to La Habra.

The 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act charged the U.S. Department of Energy to build and operate an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. Since the late 1970s - and exclusively for the past two decades - the search for a long-term storage for a nuclear waste repository has focused on Yucca Mountain. Then that effort crumbled amid legal challenges, concerns over how to transport nuclear waste to the facility and political pressures.

Nearly 50 years after he died (the same day as JFK), Aldous Huxley continues to caution us that a happyland free of intimate bonds and arduous challenges is actually a dystopia.

Denver makes far fewer headlines — despite sometimes larger crowds — by treating the 4/20 event as just another protest.
But it isn't an easy route either. The International Monetary Fund itself has available resources roughly comparable to the too-small EFSF, and there is great political reluctance in non-euro countries to increasing the IMF's size in order to help Europe.

How it works: This is a popular one in India, especially in and around Jaipur, where precious stones are currency. A friendly rickshaw driver or hotel employee will often introduce you to a friend of theirs for a "traditional Indian meal" — "they'll pay. They just like to meet people from other cultures." You meet them for a meal. They're nice, normal. They work in gems. And they approach you about moving some goods for them on your return trip home, where you'll be greeted with a large sum of money for your efforts — but not before asking you for a deposit of a couple hundred dollars on the "very valuable" gems, which are actually worthless.
Although modern furniture can look almost stark in its simplicity, it can be surprisingly comfortable. The furniture makers of the era understood ergonomics and function, Degenhard explains. Skills, techniques and materials that had been used during World War II, such as bent plywood, were applied to furniture design in the 1960s.

One of the most reliable Southern rap hitmakers, Rick Ro$$ has scored with "B.M.F.," "Maybach Music" and "Hustlin’," among other Hot 97 favorites. His character is always the same — a gruff, punch-throwing bad guy with way more money than you’ve got — but he inhabits it with so much glee that it’s tough to resist.
Afterward, an emergency medical service unit from the Denver Fire Department was sent to Harry B.

The wide-ranging exhibit, which runs through May 6, lets kids build things that fly and experience simulated flight.
Efforts to build more civil, even friendly, relationships among leaders and members of both parties are essential. It may sound naïve to suggest the equivalent of college mixers, Hill happy hours, or a summer camp where everyone has to play together, but any of these would be a better use of congressional time than the months of "bizarro" screaming and fighting, as Sen. John McCain recently said. Maybe the American people should insist that their leaders spend the remaining weeks of the summer stranded on a desert island learning to get along so that they can work together.
In addition, a weaker euro zone report sparked new concerns about the region's fiscal health.
"We just kept telling each other to keep working, that we were still in the game,'' Uhlemeyer said. "Our big problem this season has been turnovers, but tonight we did a lot better job. Then, when a few shots started to fall, we were able to get it rolling.''
Before Maurer’s sentencing, prosecutor Greg Horner urged the court to impose the presumptive sentence of 16 to 18 months. “Only a penitentiary sentence reflects the seriousness of this crime,” Horner argued.
Isn<U+0092>t that true? Isn<U+0092>t that, in fact, more true than the Young rationalizations. I, for one, have kicked a thing or two in my day. Reports are hazy, but there may or may not have been a time where I slammed my fist against a wall and put a slight crack in some drywall. (Trust me, this has far more to do with shoddy drywall than it does any sort of superhuman strength on my part.) I have a good friend who has gone through multiple cell phones because when the rubber hits the road, the wireless device goes airborne. Remember last season when Giants pitcher Brian Wilson took batting practice on the water cooler in the visiting dugout at Comerica Park? Former Yankee Kevin Brown punched a wall with his non-throwing hand (what a genius) and broke two bones. He missed three weeks of the season.

We started writing it because we felt that the center and left of Orthodox Judaism, often termed "Modern Orthodoxy," instead of bringing together the passion and commitment of its more insular brethren to the right and the openness of its more reform brethren to the left, was taking the worst of all worlds and forming a brand of religion that I think is not so uncommon today, one of not

It’s hard to get a good count, because there’s not one tea party entity, and not all who support the movement use its name in their slogans.

I looked through the cupboards to see what could be repurposed from crafts past. Always do this before embarking on a craft project; it's often amazing to see what you already own or can reuse. I found tea lights, votive holders and tall candlesticks. Brown and green tapers were purchased, red votives and small white tea lights were leftovers from last year. Pine cones were found in the back yard. They were divided into groups: one pile was painted red, the other silver. There were plenty of acorns, too, but they looked too small to make much of a visual presence so a bag of walnuts was procured at the local farmers market. The walnuts were painted red or silver. (When spray-painting, it is not necessary to completely cover the dried botanical components, it's better to let some of the natural color show through. It gives the pieces more dimension. )

I know next to nothing about astronomy, but still the sky fills me with wonder. The stars linger in the galaxies, fixed on high light years away. They lead me to wonder about the breadth of God's providence and grace. They shine with brilliance, but also mystery. They cause me to think of those oddest of all characters in the gospel, those Eastern magi.

As this budget process plays out I am realizing that I do, in fact, have much to be thankful for. Aloha staff members remain strong in their commitment to our students. Our parents and volunteer community is continuing to seek avenues to support the students. Most importantly, our student body continues to "rekindle my inner spirit" with their dedication to academic success and personal character. Finally, I am thankful to live in a democratic society, as we have the ability to address this problem, which is much larger than Aloha High School or the Beaverton School District.

Most remarkable of all is “Blame Game,” in which Kanye eavesdrops on a bedroom scene: his automaton ex-girlfriend and her new man (played by Chris Rock), who compliments West on how well he’s fashioned her into a tawdry male fantasy. Like so much on this set, the humor only amplifies the grimness. West knows that he’s dehumanizing the people he encounters, pulling them into his wobbly orbit. He’s aware that he’s doing it, and he knows the consequences. His intelligence only makes his damnation a thorough one, and his distance from other people an unbridgeable obstacle.

And let me add something else that I fought for and got in place, and that is in addition to the stick of not being able the graduate if you can't pass the graduation exam -- by the way you get five chances to pass it.

Two photographers who deserve watching are Li Lang and Adou. Both have portrayed the Yi people in the mountainous regions of southern China.

• Crawford finding comfort in new role with Trail Blazers -- Sam Amick, SI.com: But as was the case in Sacramento on Thursday night, when he hit just six of 17 shots overall and one of five three-pointers in a loss that dropped Portland to 13-10 overall and 3-9 on the road, Crawford has hardly been efficient. His 38.0 percent shooting is the second-lowest of his career, and his 32.3 percent from three-point range is his third-lowest. It should come as no surprise considering the adjustment, as the change of position means Crawford finds himself hunting for very different shots than he used to see from the off-guard spot.

"Battle Royale" (2000) is the film and novel to which "Hunger Games" has most often drawn comparisons, but there's little resemblance beyond the teens-forced-to-fight-each-other scenario. The Japanese cult classic boasts some fun and creative violence but ultimately doesn't make a lot of sense. That may be in part because the film diverges enormously from the novel's intriguing dystopian setup: The novel's program of teen carnage is intended to subjugate the population of a totalitarian state; the film's is kind of an extreme juvy hall outing.

A. The wild card, and least conclusive outcome in the case, probably also is the least likely, based on what justices said during the arguments. No justice seemed inclined to take this path, which involves the court's consideration of a technical issue. The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., held that the challenge to the insurance requirement has to wait until people start paying the penalty for not purchasing insurance. The appeals court said it was bound by the federal Anti-Injunction Act, which is intended to facilitate tax collections and keep the government operating. That law says federal courts may not hear challenges to taxes, or anything that looks like a tax, until after they are paid.

Then, after only one season on "Charlie's Angels," Fawcett decided she wanted out of the show that had made her a global icon. Whether she was doing it out of ego and ambition, or because she felt the workload (and popularity) of "Angels" was hurting her marriage to Majors, the move backfired. She and Majors separated in 1979 (though their divorce wasn't final until 1982) and Fawcett proved unready -- either as a performer or as a canny selector of material -- to be a movie star.

While early pubic impressions were being formed, the media showed only two photos of the co-protagonists. Zimmerman's was a seven-year-old mug shot of a glowering, heavyset, unshaven man in an orange prison jump-suit. (The charges against him, assault on an officer, were dropped.) In recent photos, he's thinner, better dressed and a lot friendlier looking. By contrast, the photos initially released of Trayvon were of a smiling, innocent 12- or 13-year-old boy. More recent photos of a 6-foot-tall, 17-year-old Trayvon flashing lewd hand signals convey a decidedly less endearing, more militant image.

The Republicans' report rules out tax increases in 2011 and 2012; the Democrats' report is virtually silent on that point. That may be immaterial; the Republicans, who will run both houses of the legislature in 2011 and 2012, will be Ohio's budget "deciders." And Kasich, who takes office in January, has ruled out tax increases, too.

McCoy made another nice play on a pump-fake and then throw to Josh Cribbs for 25 yards to the Steelers' 5. Two plays later from the 2, McCoy dropped back, saw the middle open and scooted and dived for the end zone. Officials signaled touchdown.

The state's strongest remaining manufacturing industry, high-tech, is based primarily in the Portland area.

Centaurus 000 00 — 0 3 1
Christians leave the church for a variety of reasons - doctrinal, structural, emotional and more. Those of us who stay are often so hurt by their leaving, or so threatened by what we think it says about those who stay, that we can't hear what they are telling us. We stop our ears, invalidate their experiences, and tell ourselves that everything is fine. I keep standing up and telling our church what a loving, supportive, inclusive community we are, when the reality is that I don't even exemplify those qualities myself.

That account of Helix's 1880 naming roughly parallels the naming of Chicken, Alaska, also in the 1880s. That story goes that when a group of miners gathered to name their community, popular choice was Ptarmigan, a plentiful, and reportedly tasty, fowl native to the area. But they couldn't agree on its spelling. After a lengthy, heated debate, one miner declared in desperation:
In May, the U.S. Commerce Department is expected to say whether it believes that Chinese manufacturers have illegally flooded the U.S. market with imported solar products.

A whole lot of folks after me have been in difficult combat situations."
TAILGATING HASN'T CHANGED
Not only do people start becoming a lot more active, many become conscious of the extra layers of fat they've stored throughout the winter months; they want to shed some pounds and look their best in summer clothing.
"During the course of this campaign, Newt demonstrated eloquence and fearlessness in advancing conservative ideas," Romney said in the statement. "I am confident that he will continue to make important contributions to our party and to the life of the nation."
"Young singles aren't interested these days in that old-style format of church, how it's always been done," Thornsberry said. "We have a small group that meets in different homes every other Monday evening. We come together for fellowship and spiritual discussion and Bible discussion. We talk about what is going on in our lives, the areas we feel like we're struggling with. And we pray for one another."
This is not a weak class of linebackers, but it’s not a particularly strong one, either. The real value will be between picks No. 10 and No. 32, where most of the quality names will start coming off the board.

"But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along."
Without playing the violin here, I was one of those whose family had been very wealthy until I was born. They sadly squandered most of what they'd acquired financially. In late 1938, 16 months after I was born, my father walked out one Sunday morning to get a newspaper and never returned, leaving my mother to raise me singularly the remainder of my pre-adult years. Those were in the pre-World War Two days and during that war, I became a 'latch-key" kid from age six until age 10, with my mother working for the War Department. She arrived home from work to the Projects in which we lived at about 9:30 every weeknight. She taught me how to open and heat cans of soup. Prior to her arrival I spent every night alone, listening to symphonies, other music-oriented programs, newscasts, serials and comedy shows on radio, and mostly in the dark. I chose the dark because it allowed me to more vividly see the fires belching from Pittsburgh's major steel mills below, manufacturing their products for the war effort. The memories are vivid. Little did I know they'd further craft any imagination or creativity within, but they did. I think those times, and the times that ensued during my teenage years in Queens and Manhattan, made me "tougher" than those who had been born into privilege and financial independence.
"We should be encouraging people to take advantage of mass transit systems, not taking them away," Sacco said in a statement.
"It certainly says we have a penalty that is far too expensive," said Jeanne Woodford, the former San Quentin warden leading the measure's campaign. "We're spending this amount of money for a handful of people and it doesn't really do anything for public safety."

It took nearly 30 years for the truth to emerge, but Farnell was a prophet.
Heating often is used to mask lower quality sakes, but some do blossom with a little warmth. However, for the most part, high-quality sakes are best consumed cold and out of wine glasses.
This seems like more fuzzy math from Sacramento and a move to stop our sheriff from using non-sworn prison guards.
Color abounds as costumer Allison Dawe has dressed the brothers in all shades of the rainbow right down to their tennis shoes, reflecting the hues in Joseph's vibrant coat. Set designer Sean O'Skea enhances the cartoon quality of the show with whimsically painted drop-down, two-dimensional Egyptian pillars and palm trees. Music director Rick Lewis keeps his band tight and tuneful. This staged comic strip of a classic legend may not be for everyone, but there are plenty of folks out there that love it. It takes all sorts to make an audience.
At this house, however, the problem looked much worse. A large section of the band board - a strip of lumber that surrounds the floor system - was completely rotted. We'd expected some damage to the band since we were sure that water (the cause of the rotting) was the culprit in the foundation settling.

So, if you want to know exactly why the Wild lacks skill compared with its opponents, look no further than the fact it wasted six consecutive first-round picks, lost Gaborik for nothing, struck gold on precious few in the 2004 to '08 drafts and has four players remaining from the 2000 to '03 drafts (Koivu, Bouchard, Josh Harding and the reacquired Stephane Veilleux).
"I've had some trips, some visits with teams, and I have to admit a few teams have put me in the small seats, the middle seats," said Miller, a 6-foot-7, 321-pound former Colorado star. "It's really more of a problem for the people around me.

“We stress in the meetings that everything stays in the room and doesn’t leave,” Marchese said.
This is one injury I have some personal experience with. I ruptured my right Achilles tendon in a pickup basketball game a couple of years ago. It wasn't a particularly painful injury, but a full rupture removes all of the support from the back of the ankle, making it impossible to bear any weight or push off with that foot. It took about four months of intense rehab after reconstructive surgery to return to normal activity, and I'm talking about the normal activity of a sportswriter, which basically entails walking, watching sporting events and eating chicken wings.
"It should be form-fitting at the top and flow-y at the bottom," she said. "A one-shoulder or off-the-shoulder dress would be lovely. I would like her in something a little more demure."
If Intel staggers construction of its new factory, however, the impact on the construction industry could be less pronounced. Oregon's unemployment rate stood level at 10.6 percent in August.

With his team nursing a 3-0 lead and his starter confounding the Miami Marlins, Matheny faced both a series of Marlins relievers and his own pitcher's pending at-bat in the eighth inning.

Best smackdown: This one was delivered by Seminole County Supervisor of Elections Mike Ertel, who was there as a neutral party to talk about the effect on local ballots. Houck had just trotted out another development-lobby talking point, about how Hometown Democracy would confuse all the poor, uninformed voters. To which Ertel responded that Americans cast ballots for the most important office on Earth — the presidency — based upon simply the first and last name of the candidates. "If we can elect a president based upon two words," said the GOP elections supervisor, "I think we can all do it based on up to 75."

Twenty-five years later, John and Annie became my friends after I married then-U.S. Rep. Sherrod Brown. In January 2007, John escorted Sherrod on the Senate floor for his swearing-in ceremony. Annie, whose gentle advice during the campaign sustained me, held my hand in the Senate gallery.

What: Conductor Bill Ives takes a refreshing look at Durufle's masterpiece, performing a lesser-known version of the work for choir, small orchestra and organ. Martin Ford presents several Durufle curios for solo organ, but the headliner is the all-male choir and soloists, whose men and boys produce a solemn, ethereal sound all their own.
In the awful comedy "Grown-Ups," there's a scene in which Chris Rock is freaked out when Maria Bello breastfeeds her child, who is "48 months," as her husband Kevin James sheepishly offers. I'm thinking that was not a favorite movie of the La Leche League.

CLEANING UP (6): If Beltran, the birthday boy, starts at cleanup this evening – and Matheny has given every indication that Beltran will stick there for awhile – he'll have more starts than any teammate at two spots in the order – No. 2 and No. 4.

Dandelions can live for years. Their main root extends down several feet. They reproduce without pollination, and their airborne seeds ride on the wind. A broken root left in the ground can spawn several more dandelions.
The movie, partly shot last spring in Ann Arbor, is scattered and overlong, and even the inherent likability of stars Jason Segel and Emily Blunt doesn't make up for the pervasive sense of strain. The film becomes so tortured, you almost start to hope these two will break up for good just because it's the pragmatic thing to do and because it would finally wrap things up.

That prospect loomed larger late Saturday when an all-GOP tax conference committee released the tax bill it intends to send to Dayton.

In fact, he said one time, "Every place I've been, I find a poet has been there before me." In other words, he thought of himself that way, he expressed himself that way.

But how to recreate the unstructured, almost improvisational feel of the film? It must have felt like the furthest thing from Broadway.

While you shouldn't make financial decisions based on emotion, we all do just that sometimes.

A: I liked the story, and I felt like there was room for interpretation. I felt like the relationship between these people, these two -- actually all of Blomkvist's relationships with women -- were unlike anything I had seen. He's not a movie hero.

But it's also a complicated thing.

-- Some resorts or hotels base their "regular" rate claim on their high-season price, even when the sale price is limited to off-season visits. That well may be the case in my example: The high-season price for a junior suite at the Caribbean property involved (in mid-February) is actually $306 per night.

Even if children and teens could be motivated to engage in some kind of physical activity, many schools have eliminated gym classes, and poor neighborhoods often lack any kind of park area for kids to play in.

"The hurricane hit Pensacola in 2004 and destroyed the town and did a lot of damage to my house, and my ex, right in the middle of it, told me she was sick of this place and was moving somewhere else with my daughter, so I had to desperately fix my house up and try to sell it and then move to Athens and live in an apartment and look for a house and buy a house and renovate a house and get married and have a baby.

School is not just a system that takes in work and gives out grades, though some students treat it as such. While there is input and output in schools, it is necessary to recognize that students typically do not learn because they turned in their homework and got an "A." We learn because we studied and understood the material. These two processes are usually related, but are by no means synonymous. A transcript full of A's is meaningless unless you have the knowledge to back it up. But why has cheating become more prevalent?
There is no registration for the event. To participate, each child must simply bring a rod, reel and bait.

Four years ago, I visited O'Leary's ranch where she houses a menagerie of rescued wild horses, a burro, emus, rabbits, sheep, a peacock, and assorted dogs and cats.

My Take: Why didn't the already cartoonish Clifford the Muppet dress up as a cat? That would have guaranteed a positive critique from me. This is a poppier and less lite-operatic take on "Memory," which is to say that nearly all of the notes have been removed from the song. In no way can I fathom this as a song choice. Webber's songs are tough, but he wrote some lilting ballads for men. Why, then, would Jason choose this massive, heart-wrenching iconic lament that was written for a powerfully voiced woman? There at least two abrupt key change that rescue Jason from having to be even vaguely musical. He keeps making his faces as if he's singing the notes, but he isn't. If you were casting a high school production of a Webber musical and a guy did this performance as an audition, you wouldn't even put him in the chorus. He sounds ridiculous, but at least some whiskers and tights could have made this high camp.

"Safe," which stars Statham as a former cop on a mission to save a girl from international gangs, appealed mostly to older men this weekend. Its opening was a bit lower than that of the typical Statham film: Last year, the action star’s "Killer Elite" started off with $9 million, while "The Mechanic" debuted with $11 million. Audiences who saw his most recent film graded it a tad higher than any of the weekend’s other new releases, giving it a B-plus CinemaScore.

It was the last that had us on edge the most. Hudson wore a vintage silver Gianni Versace chain mail dress with a gaping neckline, and when she leaned over to the microphone, we thought, well, the FCC is about to get $500,000 richer. But no, Hudson managed to avoid a mishap. She also managed to steer the spotlight away from Nicole Kidman, wearing a dreadful gown featuring strips of flesh-colored material ... just not the color of her flesh.

James Crisfield, Superintendent of Schools, adds that the willingness to compromise made all the difference: "Collective bargaining is complicated, frustrating and time consuming. This agreement, though still just tentative, is a tremendously positive development for our schools and I offer a huge 'THANK YOU' to all those on both sides who spent so much time and energy to find a way to compromise and to get it right. I can't wait to start moving forward from this and once again start accentuating all the positives we have going in the Millburn Schools."

His career homer drought is 107 at-bats, set early last season. He eventually broke out of it to lead the Cardinals to a World Series championship. There is no reason to doubt that he won't find that swing again. There is every reason to go crazy watching him search.

Some jobs, like lumberjack, are obvious choices. Though perhaps an appealing job to a young outdoorsman, unemployment for lumberjacks is high and demand for their services continues to fall. Moreover, it is physically demanding and one of the world’s most dangerous jobs.
In the 1980s, while non-Angelenos may have assumed that Milliken and Feniger were impressing customers with their exoticisms, the truth was that the chefs assumed most of the people in the dining room had tasted these things in their original form. Not all of their customers had been to Thailand, Lisbon or India, but a lot of them had; if not, Thai Town, Little Tokyo and Little India were not far away. (As Jonathan Roberts' review in the old California magazine read, if you weren't sure what chrysanthemum leaves were supposed to taste like in a salad, you were supposed to pretend that you did.) City was the first restaurant of its type that actually looked like Los Angeles.

So yeah, here comes Jeff Tedford this week. A guy Ducks fans once viewed fondly as the heir to the Oregon empire. He was Chip Kelly before anyone knew there was a Chip Kelly.

Dear K.A.: Hang your leather pants in a cool closet, but do not cover them with a plastic bag, as leather must breathe or it will become dry and brittle. Try to avoid having your pants dry-cleaned as long as possible, and then take them only to a leather specialist. The solvents used in regular dry cleaning will cause the leather to stiffen and lose its luster. For surface soil, smooth leather can be wiped with a damp cloth. For a list of dry cleaners specializing in leather, go to leatherusa.com, the website for Leather Industries of America.

That led to apologies from FSM general manager Jack Donovan. And he was apologizing a year earlier after FSM botched the most anticipated moment of that home opener, the controversial return of Mark McGwire to the team after having admitted to using performance-enhancers during his now-tainted run to the single-season home run title in 1998.

That led some fans to think it was cover-up in case McGwire was booed.

One of the most amazing traits of the amazing Rivera is his durability in a job that tends to eat its young both physically and mentally. Since last appearing on the DL, Rivera had appeared in 595 games and registered 360 saves (with a 1.89 ERA in that span).

There will representations of menehune, the mythical small people of Hawaiian culture who were said to come out at night to build structures (the Menehune Ditch on Kauai is the most famous example). The menehune will be the Hawaiian resort's version of "hidden Mickeys" – tucked away in spots around the property where children can find them in a kind of hide-and-seek visual treasure hunt.

That's a total of almost $7.7 billion -- about $1 for every $7 in general revenue spending the 2009-11 budget permitted.

The current crisis began when Israeli housing officials approved one of many steps in previously announced building plan for East Jerusalem during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden.

The company says a citrus-based solvent will leave the oil-soaked sands as clean as beach sand. According to Todd, Utah's oil sands are sweeter or lighter with less polluting sulfur than in Albert's vastly larger deposits — he called them "environmentally responsible hydrocarbons." Utah has an estimated 12 to 19 billion barrels of oil buried in its tar sands, though not all of that is considered is accessible.
Campagna said he didn't know if the recommendations were ever implemented.
Replace traditional flood lights and porch lights with LEDs (light-emitting diodes) and shy away from incandescent and halogen outdoor lighting. LEDs cost quite a bit more than standard light bulbs, but they last so long you might never have to replace them.

Q. Our ten-year-old oak tree has developed lumps at the ends of the branches which we are told are galls. They form even though the tree has been sprayed. Can the tree be saved?
So let me set the record straight. My guiding principle is, and always has been, that consumers do better when there is choice and competition. Unfortunately, in 34 states, 75% of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies. In Alabama, almost 90% is controlled by just one company. Without competition, the price of insurance goes up and the quality goes down. And it makes it easier for insurance companies to treat their customers badly - by cherry-picking the healthiest individuals and trying to drop the sickest; by overcharging small businesses who have no leverage; and by jacking up rates.
David Vitale, the newly appointed school board president for CPS, said Brizard will likely be judged on two core achievements: improving graduation rates and how well he prepares students for college and post-secondary training or work.

Public service: The Philadelphia Inquirer for its exploration of pervasive violence in the city's schools, using powerful print narratives and videos to illuminate crimes committed by children against children and to stir reforms to improve safety for teachers and students. Finalists: The Miami Herald for its exposure of deadly abuses and lax state oversight in Florida's assisted-living facilities for the elderly and mentally ill that resulted in the closure of dangerous homes, punishment of violators and creation of tougher laws and regulations, and The New York Times for the work of Danny Hakim and Russ Buettner that revealed rapes, beatings and more than 1,200 unexplained deaths over the past decade of developmentally disabled people in New York State group homes, leading to removal of two top officials, movement to fire 130 employees and passage of remedial laws.

"I was always surrounded by Kansas fans as a kid,'' he said. "I'd see blue and red and that big, ugly bird everywhere. But they hate us just like we hate them. That's what makes the rivalry so special."
True, I could have happily scarfed down a solo plate of the chopped yellowfin tuna mixed with Meyer lemon, shallots and pistachios ($10). But it shines even brighter when paired alongside scallop carpaccio -- artfully dressed with lemon-infused olive oil -- and raw, wonderfully saline clams and oysters in a platter for two ($26).
That's it. My wife thinks it's funny, but I certainly won't be committed to any state-run institutions over such behavior in the near future. I also am well aware of the fact that the two teams I root for have never won a single meaningful title game between the two of them, so perhaps my silly little rituals don't mean much at all. (Or worse yet, are actually having a negative outcome on the overall success of my teams, but let's not go there). Still, if I neglect to do one of the two parts of my routine--usually it's the appropriate coffee mug that gets forgotten--I fully expect my team to lose that day. And thanks no doubt to my selective memory, their track record is in fact pretty poor whenever I fail to live up to my end of the bargain. It's horrible.
If you believe that we need truly bold solutions to solve the fundamental problem of too much government, there's only one candidate in this race who's proven he can do it. On Tuesday, Maryland has the chance to make a stand for real change by supporting Newt Gingrich.

Against the advice of his record label, Womack put out a country album, "BW Goes C&W," in 1976.
The University of Maryland recently eliminated a number of smaller athletic programs while keeping the big-ticket items. We are trying to work our way out of a recession and most government employees have spent three years with frozen salaries and no raises and this in turn freezes future pensions at lower rates than planned. Meanwhile, Coach Crowton made a guaranteed $500,000 a year through the entire recession. Help me understand this. No wonder Governor O'Malley raised tuition.
Any delay on America's part from stopping Iran from developing nuclear weapons encourages the Iranian government not to take America seriously, Santorum said. He said it's not "bellicosity and war mongering," but an effort to stop a nuclear-armed Iran.

Mathias Kiwanuka recently got a three-year contract extension worth a total of $21.75 million that included an $8.5 million signing bonus and $10.95 million in guaranteed money.

Wouldn't this be a nice way to prove Bryant simply needed an innovative procedure on his surgically repaired right knee and sprained left ankle to retain his dominance? Perhaps. But then Bryant wouldn't have sat out for seven consecutive games to recover from a sore left shin. He wouldn't have accommodated Andrew Bynum's want for more touches in the post. And he certainly would have scored more than 18 points on seven-of-12 shooting in the Lakers' double-digit loss Friday to San Antonio.

The production is fleshed out with stock, mid-century baseball film footage and documentary-style interviews that advance and comment on the action. And there are more contemporary echoes as well: third-baseman Edmund coveting his brother Edgar's short stop job sounds like a reference to the Yankees' Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter. And Lear's petulant rage and rash decision could remind a football fan of Raiders owner Al Davis' recent behavior.
My mom would squirrel the bonds away, and every now and then my older brother and I would peek at them to see how much "money" we had. But then the inevitable financial crisis would hit our family, and my brothers and I would give our bonds to our parents. I never regretted that, or even thought much about it, until my senior year of high school, when college costs loomed. Those $25 savings bonds might not have put a huge dent in my college costs, but it would have been that much less student-loan debt to carry.

Ravens DT Haloti Ngata vs. Jets C Colin Baxter: Regular center Nick Mangold isn’t expected to play, so he’ll be replaced by Baxter, a rookie. Last week against the Raiders, Baxter didn’t have any bad exchanges or false starts with the snap count. Because of Baxter’s inexperience, the Ravens might put Ngata over his head. If that happens, the Ravens could dominate the line of scrimmage. Edge: Ravens
I am sorry for the confusion. By "at its earliest moments," I meant shortly after the big bang, back to a time when we can safely extrapolate the known laws of physics, less than a billionth of a billionth a second after the "big bang." In this case, the "big bang" represents the moment when, if we extrapolate back, all of the universe was located at a single infinitely dense point.

Though Payne used Impressionistic color and brushwork, Shields pointed out that his subjects were more like those of the Hudson River School than the quieter subjects that most California artists at the time favored. Indeed, his painting "Sycamore in Autumn, Orange County Park" done around 1917, features a giant of a tree, whose twisted trunk dominates the composition under a canopy of golden leaves. Less dramatic is a scene of eucalyptus trees that fits more easily into the sensibility of most California artists of the time.

Learning new words adds gray matter, as a matter of fact. (Your brain doesn't have to shrink with age.) And adults actually are better at learning new languages than kids, if you can put aside linguistic habits (the brain gets trained to ignore sounds that it doesn't need for comprehension) and embrace the nonsensical. That's how kids learn; they associate sounds with objects, then recognize sounds and words as labels, then link words with meaning. So to learn a new language, whether it's with a class or through audio tapes, remember these tips:

I remember the first time I went to La Habra. I had just become editor for northeast O.C. I'd been told we had a reporter based in La Habra. One day I went to visit. He was working out of a former newspaper building our company still owned, the old La Habra Star on Palm. I pulled into the parking lot. Not another car in it. Weeds grew through the cracks in the asphalt. No sign of any lights on inside. Couldn't be the place. I tried the front door. Locked. I walked around to the side and along a long block wall I found a metal door propped open an inch. I stepped in.
No, it sure didn't. Thomas hesitated and passed to Jamal Crawford with about 15 seconds left. Crawford tried to create his own shot, but he slipped, momentarily lost control of the ball, then was forced to try a difficult, baseline fadeaway to beat the shot clock.

That process was starting to happen with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), a disease that broke out of the "wet markets" of southern China in 2003 and was carried, via air travel, around the world. It infected about 8,000 people and killed 800 of them. But SARS, though a fairly lethal disease, wasn't very effective at transmission, which occurred only late in the course of illness and chiefly in hospitals, where putting very sick people on respirators aerosolized the virus and helped it spread. Quarantine of exposed people and isolation of the sick sufficed, within months, to break the chains of transmission and drive the evolving virus out of existence.

For two weeks I had been captivated by extraordinary sights -- the Great Wall near Beijing, the terra cotta warriors of Xi'an, the other-worldly karst pinnacles of Guilin and the dazzling 21st-century skyline of Shanghai -- but I also had been fascinated by the people of this dynamic, rapidly changing society, by their warmth and friendliness toward Americans and by the way they used language, not so much their own language (though I loved hearing its rapid staccato cadence), but by the way they used ours. The Chinese, I discovered, are hungry for English.
The Suns' need for Richardson to be their top scorer this season sets up well in a contract year but Richardson, who turns 30 in January, would rather not be exploring that next summer.
The idea of anyone stealing any of Cruz’s moves just a few months ago was ludicrous. As he put it Tuesday, he was “basically a nobody” before catching two touchdowns in the Week 3 victory over the Eagles. Now, he sees it as the highest of compliments when Bryant imitates him and the Cowboys stack two defenders on him at the line to limit his lateral movement on releases.
He tapped the part of his helmet that resembled moonscape and said, "You've got to put yourself on the line to play this game."

A song I like but have tired of lately because Bruce does play it a lot. But tonight it really seemed to work well in this spot. A real rocking version.
Shoddy work from the bullpen? Jason Berken allowed a two-run homer to Jacoby Ellsbury in the sixth inning, but that was nothing when you consider that the pitcher he was relieved by, Pedro Viola, didn't retire any of the four hitters he faced and managed to keep only one of them in the ballpark.
Who celebrate His birth.
The Tokyo native was working in the travel promotion industry when he became a fan of order-in room porn flicks. Too shy to frequent adult movie stores, he tracked down the producers of his favorite DVDs. "At 59, I secretly hoped they would offer me some sort of senior discount," he recalls.

The sexual activity is a crime because of the girl's age. The age of consent in Washington is 16.
Brash Bobby, who boasted last Sunday about his protection being so excellent that the seat of his pants wasn't soiled, hit the turf with just about every part of his anatomy. Bob Gain, Bill Quinlan and Colo bounced him about like a rubber ball several times.

I looked back at my dad, but he was gone.
This is the sixth offensive coordinator in eight years for UCLA. Philosophies, some with "War and Peace"-length playbooks, have come and gone. Yet, the offensive doldrums have remained since quarterback Drew Olson and running back Maurice Jones-Drew left after the 2005 season.
The casting of Hugh Laurie as cranky, crippled Dr. House, endlessly irritated by patients and staff and everything but the cerebral medical mysteries he enjoyed, took the series to a different level. Laurie was so great - perfect, in fact - in the role that for years, just watching him was enough to make an enjoyable hour.
Promising "improvements" to the state's controversial bullet train plan, the new head of the project told a Senate hearing in Silicon Valley on Tuesday he now believes building high-speed rail would cost less than the alarming estimate of nearly $100 billion.

The one move we'd like to see, if only to bring one more interesting team to the party? Steve Nash to Orlando. Problem: There are ways to make it add up to $11.6M, but good luck convincing Phoenix that Ryan Anderson can't be part of the exchange. If Boston decides to bust it up, we want to see Ray Allen on the Clippers — just to keep OKC, the runaway best out West — honest.

Renacci has also engaged in litigation with former business partners including Frank E. Murphy, who lives on Renacci's street in Wadsworth. In April 2006, Murphy filed a $200,000 lawsuit against Renacci that sought to dissolve a business that provided lease financing and construction management for nursing homes. Murphy alleged Renacci wrote checks from partnership accounts totaling more than $320,000 "for his own purely personal benefit and gain." Renacci countered that Murphy had diverted $850,000 in the partnership's assets.

Ironically, Los Angeles has forgotten more about mass transit than most cities will ever know. In 1886, the year of Benz's patent, construction began on the nation's first overhead electric transit line, the Los Angeles Electric Railway, a modest little route that ran through the streets of downtown L.A. A couple of decades hence, Henry Huntington consolidated various transit companies to form the Pacific Electric Railway, which at its peak had more than 1,100 miles of track and 900 of its famous Red Cars serving, in 1944, more than 109 million riders.

"A good part of the time we spent today was clarifying the problem," Schumaker said.
HBO’s much-hyped swordsy fantasy epic Game of Thrones packed loads of stuff into its premiere episode Sunday: severed bodies, more sex. But it’s a matter of some debate whether strong female characters are part of the Game plan. There’s no doubt that among the seemingly infinite cast there are women — and memorable ones, at that. The question is whether they’re an endless parade of misery and victimhood or inspiring figures who triumph in a very masculinized fictional world where no one even thinks of giving the titular headwear to a chick.
And the desired result of that pitch seems like a good place to

In his much-traveled production of Bizet's "Carmen," for example, he takes his cue from the verb tenses in the tenor's aria. A scrim is lowered over the singer when the words describe the past and rises when, at the end, the present is evoked.
Good to know, Manny. Good to know a cheater is at ease. I'm sure all the clean players in the game feel the same way.
In January, 2011, the Congregation for the Clergy issued a ruling saying St. Stanislaus should not have been closed. The bishop appealed to a higher Vatican panel, the Apostolic Signatura, which, in October, upheld the Congregation's ruling.

Maybe for some people it actually isn't about the money.
Students of estoterica, take note: The skills of various specialists in "Leonardo's Lost Princess" demonstrate why the study of the past is never a waste of time, even if the money-making world puts its value elsewhere. If you dig ancient mysteries, keep digging them. Some day your skills might be needed. Faulkner was right.

"What we're seeing is that more and more people want to put on festivals," said Cohen, a Democrat. "And without a clear basis for making a judgment call whether a festival will be good or bad, things can get out of hand. Frankly, whatever the city council ends up adopting, it needs to reflect the fact that there is no one festival that is going to please everybody. Annapolis is way too diverse a place for that."

The TSA directive outlined new screening measures that went into effect the same day as the airliner incident at Detroit. It included many procedures that would be apparent to the traveling public, such as screening at boarding gates, patting down the upper legs and torso, physically inspecting all travelers' belongings, looking carefully at syringes with powders and liquids, requiring that passengers remain in their seats one hour before landing, and disabling all onboard communications systems, including what is provided by the airline.

Moiseyenko said she hopes the hospitalization and treatment will prompt Tymoshenko to end her hunger strike.
Overall, these things go in cycles for hoops. While we are fairly steady and/or growing in other sports areas, our basketball is up and down. We have had years in which there have been two guys going to Boston College (wow!) and others in which there have been none above the D-II level. A lot of it is reflective of our population and location. The Rocky Mountains have rarely been a hoops mecca or factory. But it would be nice if it was, wouldn't it?

Sure he does. Obama always treats Hispanics like he's doing us a favor. What other bloc of voters gets talked to this way? In politics, what matters is results; not good intentions. Besides, given that he has deported more than 1.2 million illegal immigrants, we're still not sure what Obama's true intentions are.

"If these reports are true, this is a dark day for freedom and it's a day of shame for the Obama administration. We are a place of freedom, here and around the world, and we should stand up and defend freedom wherever it is under attack."
The U.S. attorney's office in Seattle has been weighing Moonen's case for the past two years, spending much of that time reviewing whether U.S. courts would have jurisdiction, and the Justice Department sent a team of four prosecutors and an FBI agent to Iraq last summer to investigate.

The sashimi -- salmon, tuna, yellowtail, or a combo -- have fresh, delicate flavors. But the rolls can feel redundant. A spicy dynamite roll fails to explode. The Special Hiro roll isn't.

A During my student years I had opportunities to study and work with a lot of great people.

He had an exceptionally open ear and mind, and found ideas and inspiration in all kinds of music. Another major influence was my composition teacher at UC Berkeley, Andrew Imbrie, one of the master composers of his generation.
In the wake of Tyler Clementi's death in 2010, the gay community at Rutgers University lobbied for "gender-neutral" housing in which men and women could be roommates. The thinking was that a gay student might feel more comfortable — or even safer — rooming with a female friend.

Voters in Cuyahoga County like to elect judges with familiar names. But thanks to the efforts of four bar groups that evaluate judicial candidates as the Judge4Yourself.com coalition, that habit is changing.

"I don't get the feeling from what I've heard her saying today that that is the route she's going to take ... I think she's trying to have it both ways.

Limpert says that from the district's perspective the legal summary - wrongful death lawsuit settled by the district for $50,000 - looks far worse than what actually happened.
Going with a limited selection that the kitchen can execute in the small space is smart. The menu changes about once a week (check online), though one or two dishes may cycle in during that time. At $34 (not including supplements), the price is affordable enough to make Papilles a guilty habit. I wish they'd rethink the wine policy, though, and as money comes in, buy some less clunky wine glasses.
"But we can't afford to operate the 300 acres that surround the fort," he said.
After the break-ins, Zimmerman's calls to 911 seemed to shift, zeroing in on black males. Were black males actually responsible for any of the crimes reported in the Retreat? Impossible to say. Morgenstern, the police spokesman, said last week that he was too overwhelmed with media requests to get the arrest records on individual cases.
It initially showed up on cave walls but has become a pop-culture icon that now appears on everything from kitchen curtains to light switches.

“It really allows you to focus on yourself, not so much prep work for the other team,” the Glen Burnie native and Old Mill graduate said. “We had two stretches where we went through three games in seven or eight days, and we really just focused on ourselves and executed and sharpened some things up and then not as much personnel work for the other team. We really focused on ourselves. So I think that plays to our strengths at times because we know how good we can be and if we just perfect the things we need to do, I think we can beat anybody we need to. So in terms of playing Denver on Wednesday, we’re going to come to work on Monday, we’re going to watch the game, we’re going to correct some things and then we’re going to get after it in practice on Monday.”

No one will mistake these hills for the Rockies or the Smokies; their vertical drops mostly run between 200 and 600 feet.
One man in Northern California, looking for more comfort, began using an ergonomic bike saddle last fall. The seat, with a protruding nose, was advertised as "helpful in reducing the risk of cycling-associated genital numbness and sexual dysfunction." But after using the saddle for a few months, the 52-year-old began having trouble maintaining an erection. His doctor advised him to give up the bike. He didn't -- and suffered the consequences. "After a time it didn't work at all," says the man who requested anonymity.

The Marlins have lost five in a row in San Diego.
The Addams Family was comprised of patriarch Gomez, his wife Morticia, their two children Wednesday and Pugsley, Uncle Fester, Grandmama, Lurch the butler and Thing. Drenched in irony, the rich family appeared to take pleasure in everything morbid and seemed oblivious in recognizing they were scaring those around them. From their origin to Addams's death in 1988, the characters appeared as single panel cartoons -- roughly 250 in all, says Playbill. In fact, according to The Star-Ledger's own Peter Genovese (who wrote about The Addams Family house in July), the artist's output for The New Yorker included 65 covers and about 1,300 cartoons total.
LeVert, who grew 2 to 3 inches last summer, led Central to an Ohio state title and 26-2 record. He was named the most outstanding player on the 2012 Associated Press Division I all-tournament team. He scored 43 points in the semifinal and final games combined.

He has also studied under renowned guitarist Eliot Fisk, who has become a mentor and friend.
That’s the whole point of “The Descendants,” which has Clooney facing a number of moral quandaries. Does he sell the ancient family estate to a developer, as his relatives are urging? Does he take advantage of his wife’s helplessness to settle a few old scores, use her enforced silence to finally tell their friends his side of things?

The outfielder would automatically be the best all-around player on the defending World Series champions. The Giants' pitching gets them pretty far, but eventually they'll need someone who can hit.
Here is the list so far of the Browns' 2012 pre-draft visits and workouts:
You don't create these kinds of ties on Facebook, Twitter, or Google+. For that matter, they don't happen during momentary encounters on the MetroLink either.
But his cautionary words served as notice that attacks on faiths should, in his view, be off the table. He appealed to the social conservatives to support a presidential candidate who has the best record on the economy.
So far this year, the deficit is running at an annual rate of $350 billion, about half of the $695.9 billion deficit for all of 2008. Economists believe that trend will continue as weakness in the U.S. depresses demand for imported goods.
You would be wrong. There is one area—expanding the number of visas given to highly skilled foreigners, particularly those who learned math and science at American universities—where two senators have found a lot of bipartisan agreement. And a whole lot of business-community support to boot. But that doesn't mean anything actually will happen this year. And therein lies a sad tale of Washington's dysfunction.
The Cranes admit that their contemporary home stands out in Rochester, but said they consider it their escape after a long day at the clinic.

Zhang found that expanding and new businesses created about 102,000 jobs in Maryland during the worst quarter of the recession, the first three months of 2009. But the gains were outnumbered by losses from businesses cutting back or closing, resulting in an overall loss of 82,000 jobs.
The immediate concern, however, is jobs. The Labor Department issues its March employment report on Friday. Economists expect the report to say that employers added jobs in March for only the second time since the recession began in December 2007.
After taking office, FitzGerald quickly had to plug a budget hole of more than $4 million.
“Our patients are here for a long time and we see just about everything,” she said. “What I love best is developing a relationship with the patients and their families. When I see a little progress, I get excited and there are just no words to describe how it feels when I see a patient walk out of the hospital.”
Beitashour and Morrow have benefited from the special tutelage of Yallop and assistant coach Mark Watson, who played fullback in England and MLS.
Another fundamental flaw in the Cascade study is its attempt to suggest that our pseudoephedrine law did nothing to reduce meth use. Our law was not designed to address meth use; it was about domestic meth manufacturing. Most meth comes from Mexico, which has banned pseudoephedrine entirely and forced the drug cartels to switch to methods of manufacture without pseudoephedrine, a more difficult process that results in weaker meth.
The rebuilt plant is now testing its turbines in preparation for selling electric power in the region next month. Fumes from the turbine tests have prompted complaints of noxious odors from area residents, and the state Department of Environmental Protection has stepped up its monitoring of the testing phase.

So who does Scotland Yard accuse of trying to derail its inquiry? Police have refused to say — although they named News International and its legal representatives as other parties to its information.
The option of deducting sales taxes is especially popular in Florida, Texas, Nevada, Washington and other states that don't have their own income tax. But you don't have to live in those states to be eligible for this option. Many people who live in other states and who itemize their deductions may find it advantageous to deduct their sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes.
It was announced during the show that Cena and Lesnar would face off at the Extreme Rules pay-per-view later this month in a no-countout, no-disqualification "extreme rules" match.
"He's a little bit more comfortable and can be who he really is," Wade said. "Last year was tough. I'm sure no one can deal with the things he dealt with publicly and all the scrutiny that he took. I thought he did a good job with it. This year it's a little bit more quiet and he can just focus on being LeBron James, the family man and the athlete and not everything else.
The governor seems to pluck numbers out of the air. One week he claims that the fraud rate is 25%; the next week it’s 10%. In fact, quality-assurance reviews for the In-Home Support Services program at the state and county levels consistently suggest a far lower rate. And one thing the governor won't mention: He's cut funding for case management, dependent-adult abuse prevention and background checks, and has vetoed legislation to improve home-care worker training and set training standards -- all of which would reduce fraud and protect and better serve consumers.
Chandler has had plenty of good ones since becoming the No. 2 pick in the 2001 draft out of high school, but recognition only came recently. Being the defensive anchor for an NBA champion, followed by his impact in New York, made it impossible not to notice him.

What has Benson done? Nothing. After all, Payton got him a Super Bowl ring. Is there a boss running a business - legitimate or not - in this country who would stand by someone who not only lied and deceived him, but to everybody, including his accusers? You don't lie to your boss. If you do (and get caught), adios, amigo. But it doesn't apply in professional sports.

The latest study establishes that despite safety concerns about this class of drugs for such patients, the medications are used by many in the wake of a heart attack. Of 83,677 Danish heart attack patients followed in the study, 42.3% received NSAIDs from Danish pharmacies, which keep records that allowed researchers to piece together each patient's medication history. In all, 35,257 of those patients had a repeat heart attack or died.

"What do you want besides pork?" Fang repeated.
If these ideas don't suit them, the "occupy" folks could always sue the airlines for allowing cockroaches on board flights, thereby causing mental anguish. That's what couple Harry Marsh and Kailin Rush are doing. In fact, if enough people would sue each other for these types of damages, they could all get rich and narrow that income gap in no time. There's an idea!

"Some people just can't continue to work beyond age 62 for either health reasons or they're just not able to find jobs," said David Certner, legislative policy director for AARP.

"The Real Housewives of New Jersey" reunion show seemed strained for obvious reasons -- it can't be comfortable for Danielle Staub to share space with Caroline Manzo, Dina Manzo and Teresa Giudice, who have made their distaste for Staub and her antics perfectly clear.

The second-ranked Nadal's 21st straight victory on clay followed up his eighth straight win in Monte Carlo, as Nadal won the 10th all-Spanish ATP final for the 48th win of his career.
Nowhere in her report did Hightower talk about the fans. If track and field ever is going to regain its foothold in the U.S. sports scene, somebody is going to have to care about the people who buy tickets and tune into televised meets.
Mr. Staatz argues that the legislation is needed because community banks aren't lending. Nothing could be further from fact. Banks are actively lending and looking for lending opportunities. Banks earn a much higher return on loan interest than they do earnings on investments these days. Despite the sluggish economy, banks added over $180 billion in business loans over the last 18 months. Here in Maryland, more than $204 million in Small Business Administration Loans were made in 2011 alone, the vast majority by banks and the highest total in 10 years. Business lending increased 13.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 and totaled $1.3 trillion, according to the FDIC.

Inclusion is not abstract. It has been an enabler for the regime to suppress and kill demonstrators as "mohareb" (enemy of God) and has provided an excuse to pressure and suppress Ashraf residents. Ali Saremi, Iran's most prominent political prisoner and an activist of the PMOI, was hanged as a mohareb in Tehran on Dec 28.

And now Summitt comes to Jersey, perhaps for the last time. If you’re lucky enough to get a seat, you’ll remember this night for the rest of your life, and it will have nothing to do with basketball. It will be about one indomitable lady’s trademark defiance. Her courage.
I whooshed past him and flung open the door. Kirk's papers were gone, too.
While it's common for American and European symphonies to offer classes to the public, typically those programs involve longer commitments to a practice schedule, in preparation for a public performance alongside the professional orchestra. San Francisco put a twist on it by offering a one-night experience of hands-on mentoring for adults, with a final run-through at the end of the evening. And they kept it affordable: $40 for instrumentalists, and $20 for singers. Friends and family can sit in the audience. No auditions are required.

In that regard, his two ejections in 2 ½ weeks are not unlike the eager-beaver 3-point shot he launched at Golden State in between the losses to Houston. He's flexing new muscles, testing limits and figuring out what referees, coaches and opponents can do to stop him now that he has such newfound power.

The film is directed by long-time photographer Anton Cobijn, who last made the excellent Joy Division drama “Control.” And like that film, “The American” is both meticulous about its compositions, and uninterested in providing typical genre sensations.
Illinois - and Chicago in particular - is home to a substantial Latino population. If Chicago is to remain a world-class city and Illinois is to entice companies to bring their jobs here, we need to have an educated workforce. And that starts with preschool.
Sanu and Simms are local prospects so their visits won't count against the maximum 30 allowed for non-local players. But the private workout indicates the team wanted to take a close look at Sanu or both. The Giants will hold a large workout for many local players on Thursday.

You bet. Using a plant sterol spread every day could knock down your lousy LDL cholesterol by 14 percent. Plus, people who regularly use these heart-helping spreads also have lower rates of lung, breast, stomach and prostate cancers. Just don't put one big blob on your morning whole-wheat toast. Plant sterols do their job best in small doses, so spread 'em throughout the day (1 tablespoon of Smart Balance -- a spread with more sterols than most -- two or three times a day is about right). Sterols are substances found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and beans that limit your body's ability to absorb cholesterol from food. Pair them with a cholesterol-fighting statin drug, and you'll kick down LDL by another 10 percent.
Shinn said he will likely need to file for bankruptcy.
The VI Congress of Cuba's Communist Party approved a wide array of pro-market economic reforms. Their details have not been disclosed at the time of this writing, but some well-placed Cuba watchers say the new rules are likely to lead to an economic opening, much like China's economic reforms of 1978 or Vietnam's transition to a "socialist-oriented market economy" in 1986.

Obama said the public doesn't like to see tax dollars wasted, but does want to see money spent in areas that help the country thrive. In Ohio, Obama visited a successful job-training program of the type the White House says would face steep cutbacks in federal financing under the House-passed budget, which Romney supports. And in Michigan, the president will scoop up more campaign cash to help him combat Romney's efforts to frame his presidency as an economic failure.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, any cutbacks in service at John Wayne Airport were often replaced by new routes or new airlines. Capacity caps kept a sometimes long line of new airlines on a waiting list for as long as three years.

Several companies did warn that their cargo needed more space. Feel for them. Thompson Metal Fab President John Rudi told a reporter for The Columbian that his company "had notified CRC as far back as 2006 that we were looking for at least a 125-foot clearance." But given the landscape, with a new bridge having to accommodate both river traffic and air travel nearby while assisting a whole lot of commuters, it is debatable whether the bridge can or should have to accommodate a few companies' large river loads or future large loads. This could be a puzzle without a perfectly fitting piece, just one that works best. And this community might have to settle for less than perfect.

The experimental Russian director, who has staged the avant-garde 90-minute piece in French and Russian with English supertitles, concentrates on the eye and the brain here, instead of the heart. Nobel laureate Ivan Bunin's melancholy tale of love lost and found takes the form of a postmodern montage of Paris.

We want to reach this group, as well as senior citizens, because they deserve to have a mammogram and early detection information about breast cancer. Men, too, can be diagnosed with breast cancer.

The only book that is not billed as "97% true" is "Barrel Fever" from 1994. Although the humor in this first collection is ample and undeniable, even his best-drawn fictional characters aren't as gripping as reading about his friend of a friend at a lunch counter.

Many environmental groups accused the Democratic president of embracing former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's "drill, baby, drill" philosophy. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, criticized the president for not going still further to promote American energy production and create more jobs.
What the NYPD is doing is simply good — and entirely legal — police work. The events of 9/11 obliged the department to transform itself from a municipal police force into a combination cop shop, intelligence service and paramilitary organization that can and does operate globally, not just locally.
And Bruce Jr., will not be in the stands with the rest of the family. He’ll be walking the sidelines, wearing No. 51, a sophomore back-up center/guard for the 2011 Irish football team. He might even get on the field.
"Could this be anything other than a boat in distress?" he wondered.
"They stopped providing service to children at risk," he said. "Either those families didn't need service, or we will see an increase in referrals. My guess is that it will be the latter."

Kroger chronicles his life and his experiences as U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York from 1997 to 2001 in his popular book: "Convictions: A Prosecutor's Battle Against Mafia Killers, Drug Kingpins, and Enron Thieves."
Reading the news reports of the JCIA's $7 million deficit was disheartening. The deficit should not surprise anyone who knew that the JCIA's revenue was slashed by the city each of the last two years. The news reports suggest the city essentially cut JCIA's funding and railroaded them into debt. Now administrators have given themselves an excuse to fold the agency most responsive to the daily needs of the city and its residents.
Should Hamilton choose elsewhere, will other recruits panic? Even if they stick, it will be looked at as Flood being unable to corral a player who seemed Rutgers bound less than a week ago.
Dominion customers buying gas in this program are paying the lowest rates in seven years. Columbia Gas of Ohio uses a traditional method to set prices, which are then double-checked by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.

Eric Lamb, who works for Vessel Assist, a private maritime assistance firm, was one of the first on scene, spotting a small refrigerator, a seat cushion and some food containers in the water.

The verdict ended a lengthy trial and an investigation initiated by a tip to the Portland Police Bureau's cold case squad.
Perhaps more important is the source’s role. According to the affidavit, the FBI directed the source to attend a demonstration on Oct. 21, because law enforcement had “an initial report of potential criminal activity and threats involving anarchists who would be attending” a protest in Cleveland. At the demonstration, the source made the first contact with some of the suspects.
"There I was, alone, up fromWashington, D.C., with just my trunk," Simmons recalled. The dorm managers gave her a list of families that rented rooms to black students, but they were all far from campus. For that entire first semester, Simmons had to walk seven miles to school every day.
Two sides to a story: Danielle's friends Kim Granatell, Kathy, Anna Maria and Sue meet her for dinner, where Danielle gives her perspective on the tete-a-tete. Suffice it to say, Dina's recollection is slightly more accurate. For example, we see Dina touch her head when she tells Danielle that she's (bleeping) crazy. In Danielle's mind, Dina is leaning down into her and waving her finger dramatically around in the universal sign for insanity. Then Danielle reads an email Dina sent her in which Dina tells her she was her biggest supporter and tried to convince the others to see her in a different light. Not sure if we believe that, but okay. She also accuses Danielle of causing chaos at the Brownstone on purpose. Which we do believe. Dealing with this whole Dina business, Danielle insists to her pals, is empowering!

The best bit was a trio of groupings of two men partnering a single woman. The choreographer’s costume designs -- cool wedged tutus in brown paired with yellow sleeveless blouses -- got clever mirroring across the sexes. The marvelous Matthew Rich, with his Mohawk hairdo our favorite Cedar Lake dancer, appeared in funny pantaloons. He was always where the action was.

At least some people saw the crash developing. Another Liberty Tours helicopter pilot on the ground at the heliport saw the plane approaching the helicopter and tried to radio an alert to the pilots, New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. The warning either wasn't heard, or didn't happen in time.
Still, Biggert is campaigning and said she "is taking nothing for granted."
A reception followed at the Club.
Legislation was needed because taxes can otherwise only be raised in quarter-cent increments. Voters rejected a county-sponsored tax in 2006 calling for a half-cent hike, and BART supporters believe a smaller increase might be easier to get voter approval.

It's not that this was a flawless effort. In fact, the Browns and Patriots went head-to-head in the first half on an inordinate amount of foul-ups, bleeps and blunders. Even the officials got in on the act with broken chains that had to be fixed twice.
Fudge, of Warrensville Heights, is the only black Ohioan now in Congress. Given the federal Voting Rights Act, her district is probably safe from Republican mapmakers anyway. But when Batchelder, the most conservative Ohio House speaker in decades, makes such a pledge -- after an introduction at Thursday's meet-and-greet by no less than George Forbes, a patriarch of black politics -- that's big-stakes bridge-building. And earlier Thursday, Batchelder visited with the Call & Post, Ohio's Cleveland-based black newspaper, owned by Don King, and also visited Karamu House, the nationally renowned black cultural institution.

"It should’ve been a major wakeup call for the country and the city. It wasn’t," Kelly said. "It was sort of written off as a being an inept group of individuals, it wasn’t seen to be tied to an international movement. We paid the price."
More than three years ago, Oakes and her team - chefs Pamela Mazzola and Ravi Kapur and manager Kathy King - decided that after 15 years in business they were ready to open a second, more casual place.

Additionally, certain fees and costs were much greater than anticipated. The race track crossed the heart of downtown Baltimore (as most regular Baltimore commuters are well aware). It was designed to showcase the Inner Harbor, the Baltimore Convention Center and Oriole Park at Camden Yards. However, the very components that made the venue so compelling for spectators, drivers and TV viewers drove up costs considerably. The venue proved to be far more costly than other street events on the IndyCar series. Most of these additional costs came in the form of fees and costs imposed by the city, the Maryland Stadium Authority and the convention center.

Veteran J.C. Romero's job description is "lefthanded specialist." Few jobs have been performed with more efficiency than his work in the sixth inning of the Cardinals' 5-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs Saturday at Busch Stadium.
Galt had its beginnings during the Gold Rush, when a group of farmers settled around the banks of Dry Creek, a small stream near Galt. In 1869, the town was laid out by the Western Pacific Railroad, and rancher John McFarland named the community Galt after his hometown in Canada. In 1869, the post office opened at Fourth and B streets. According to the city website, by the year 1880, Galt had two general-merchandise stores, a variety store, a hotel, a harness shop, two blacksmith shops, two saloons, a meat market, three physicians and one attorney. Today, some of the 100-year-old buildings in the downtown core are under renovation to reflect the community's roots. The Galt Chamber of Commerce website celebrates Galt's simple, bucolic appeal. <U+0093>Although Galt does not have the hustle and glitter of a large city,<U+0094> the site says, <U+0093>it does have the breathtaking sunsets, the song of a variety of birds and the peace of a quiet countryside.<U+0094>
Notes: Brown said he expects F Metta World Peace to be rested, not rusty when his suspension is over: "He's working hard. He's engaged. I think he'll be fine.

The Lakers have only squandered one 2-0 series lead, losing to the Phoenix Suns in 1993. ... Denver's seven turnovers were one shy of their all-time playoff low.

The 18-year-old deliveryman from Sicklerville drove to the 100 block of Ashland Avenue in Lawnside. There, authorities said, the teens ambushed him, hitting him in the head and hand with a baseball bat.
You have the opportunity, if you're a large corporation, to have a lot more folks looking at these things and drilling down and structuring your company so you can respond to how the tax code operates. That's simply not the case with a small businessperson. So I would just say that having a flat tax on corporate taxes is going to be a great equalizer in many respects.

Those qualities have sustained Michael "Mike D" Diamond, Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz and Adam "MCA" Yauch -- ladies and gentlemen, the Beastie Boys! -- over a trailblazing career in hip-hop that stretches back to the early 1980s, when the notion of young white men rapping challenged the status quo. At best, it was seen as a novelty. At worst, it was viewed as an attempt to co-opt a predominantly black art form.
He and his colleagues at OHSU advocate "active surveillance," or carefully watching early-stage prostate cancer. A patient with early stage prostate cancer, for instance, might get a PSA test every three to six months, so their doctor can track changes, no matter how small. They might also undergo repeated prostate exams and biopsies at intervals that make sense on a patient-by-patient basis.

In boom years, pay raises might make sense. But these are bust years. State funding cuts have forced the trustees to raise mandatory fees and tuition for next fall to $7,017 - double what CSU cost just five years ago. Also, to save money, CSU has announced it will accept no new admissions in the spring semester. When a university system has to turn away qualified students and raise tuition for those admitted, it should not be asking everyone - except the highest-paid executives - to sacrifice.

Under the current system, the immigrants who qualify for a visa, and ultimately a green card, must return to their homeland to pick it up. But the problem is that the moment they leave the U.S., they trigger an automatic sanction that bars them from returning for up to 10 years. Some immigrants can secure a special waiver to return, but they must demonstrate that their absences will create extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen parent or spouse.
"I saw the steeple fall about a quarter past 2," he said. "I was at a loss for words."
When the Cardinals brass talks about Jake Westbrook improving upon his inconsistent 2011, they mention the defense behind him and the trust he can show in his sinker. When the Cardinals' players describe how reliant they can be this season on their pitching staff and the return of Adam Wainwright, the need for defense is implied. And when asked about last year's adrift defense, the same name kept coming up as a remedy, because whatever he was bringing during the late run last fall he's expected to bring back.
_ HOW MANY HOME RUNS WILL ALBERT PUJOLS HIT? After ending the longest power drought of his career, the three-time NL MVP was still hitting in the .190s. He's in a new, better league, facing many pitchers he's never seen, playing in a park that's not ultra-homer friendly. His $240 million contract draws a lot of attention, but these are the numbers worth noticing — 47 homers in 2009, down to 42 in 2010, down to 37 last year with St. Louis. The call: Pujols drops again, and finishes with 33.

The new approach takes a little while to get used to, but makes for a better album, and a much more interesting perspective. "Mondo Amore" concludes with two dynamite tracks: the slow-building "Heavy Boots," a desperate prayer (set to a gorgeous-sounding church organ) and "The Tower," a six-minute waltz-tempo roller-coaster ride pitched somewhere between Dusty Springfield and Big Brother and the Holding Company. When Atkins hits the final chorus and begins to wail about a tower crumbling down, she sounds as if she’s pushed past exhaustion and discovered something essential about herself. Most of the narrators on "Mondo Amore" have reached similar conclusions: They’ve squeezed wisdom from disaster and, having survived the worst, are surveying a tattered world with brand new eyes.

A: Wolves in general get a very bad rap in terms of how they interact with people. But they're really very nervous around people, not aggressive by any means. Their reputation is as the Big Bad Wolf from children's stories. And they are a top predator in the ecosystem. They're necessary to keep prey populations in check. Without them, we have the current situation with deer and moose and elk where there can be overpopulation because there aren't enough predators. But the wolf, in general is an elusive animal, not aggressive, but very family oriented. The mom and dad cooperatively raise puppies, a lot like us.

City Manager Carol Jacobs told us the city "laid off" one part-time and five full-time city workers in July 2011 and five full-time, six part-time and seven parks-and-recreation commissioners in April 2012.

But the current staffing of 34 employees is just below the 36.5 in 2002.

Ironically, it is the very people crying intolerance who are practicing it. Cardinal Timothy Dolan, president of theU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, perhaps said it best in defending the Catholic Church against such baseless claims: "We reject all hatred and unjust treatment against any person.

After passing through a narrow corridor at the entrance, I found a small bar winding along the wall to the right, an elevated DJ booth to the left, and a large wooden dance floor covering the center area. At one end of the dance floor was a small stage, complete with go-go dancer cages, and pool tables filled the space at the fourth end. Several tables and benches completed the scene of the combination nightclub/neighborhood watering hole. The walls, decorated with a brick and stone arch motif, gave the bar — strangely enough — an bit of a Mediterranean feel.

"That's My Boy": After watching Adam Sandler go to broad slapstick extremes to play his twin sister in "Jack and Jill," those memories of him stretching his acting skills in "Punch-Drunk Love" are fading fast. But the "Saturday Night Live" veteran's next project could be inspired silliness, especially because it will pit him against a new-generation "SNL" star. In "That's My Boy," current cast member Andy Samberg plays his son -- the product of a teen fling -- whom dad hasn't seen for years. But as Samberg's character approaches his wedding, Sandler's character arrives minus an invite and ready for reconciliation. Do you take this movie as your opportunity to see who'll be more immature?

While small tech companies are learning to play the patent game, at least one larger one is trying to change the rules altogether.

Los Angeles is so movie-saturated that you forget the crimes were real.

The embroidery consists of lilies (Middleton's favorite flower), daffodils (official flower of Wales) and roses (to represent Kenya, where Prince William proposed).

The entire dress is covered in crystal and pearl beading. The veil is very dramatic with pickups tacked with rose appliques and crystals. The "royal train" length would be 9 feet from the waistline.
Ms. Jacobs said, "Employees have not received any cost-of-living increases or raises in the past four fiscal years." True.

Sloth is a capitol sin in Columbus, given the laziest General Assembly in living memory. Latest example: The failure of the Senate, led by Republicans, and the House, led by Democrats, to craft a reform of how Ohio draws legislative districts. Wednesday came and went -- the deadline for placing such a reform on November's ballot so Ohioans could vote it up or down. Ohio legislators, last seen in Columbus June 4, did nothing.

The new picture starts big, with an attack on the Kremlin.

"Gold Rush": More Oregon connections, as Todd Hoffman, of Sandy, and his crew keep on looking for that elusive yellow stuff. Tonight, according to the Discovery show description, "With the all-important washplant prepped, the Hoffman crew is finally ready to process dirt. They install a clean-out tent with gold expert Fred Doge but a broken loader leaves them with nothing to feed the washplant. Harness' attempt to fix it aggravates his back injury. With the team mechanic forced to abandon them for medical help, the loader repair is left to a pair of local mechanics."

The waiver rule is part of the polluters’ agenda across the country to get rid of environmental protections. The rule has nothing to do with New Jersey, but is part of Christie’s national agenda to sell off New Jersey’s environment to polluters and developers. We are going to court because the rule violates the Constitution, legislative intent and the separation of powers. We believe that the governor’s administration has overstepped its authority and has abused its authority by taking the side of special interests over the people of New Jersey. Since the waiver rule is so vague and open-ended, it will allow for abuse and political pressure from developers and polluters.

Cancer seems to be heading in a new direction. This isn't due, in large part, to declining rates, which tend to be modest. Last week the Centers for Disease Control issued a report noting that overall rates had dropped in the U.S. for the fourth straight year, but the decrease hovers at around 1.5% annually.

Only the remaining one-third are linked to genetic mutations from all other causes, including toxins, radiation, environmental influences, etc.

The company also said it expects to return to investment-grade status “in the near term.” Ford lost its investment-grade rating in 2005, when it was deeply in debt. It borrowed $23 billion in 2006 to fund a restructuring that slashed employees and brands and revamped vehicles. The company recently reported its eighth-straight quarterly profit.
The reason, I suspect, is that vibration throws off the way your body is used to moving, forcing it to activate small, rarely-used muscles and fire in multiple directions at once, thereby accentuating the natural muscle-building process. In that way, vibration plates also would seem to be an excellent tool for stretching and improving balance.
He was also a member of the Chantilly Country Club in Rising Sun and the Newark Country Club in Newark, Del.
Some where, some time, someone is going to get hit and seriously injured. I would hope those riding have some kind of insurance to cover any accident either with a pedestrian or vehicle. If not, it should be mandatory for those riding a bike to carry some sort of liability insurance just as those who operate a motor vehicle. And, in and around parks, where there is a large concentration of pedestrian traffic, bicycles should not be allowed to be rode the sidewalk and signs should be posted.
So who is telling the truth? It easily could be that both are. I believe my source is telling the truth, otherwise I would not have printed what they said. I also believe that James might be wrestling with some aspects of the decision. He loves his teammates. He loves his coaches. He's said numerous times how much he loves the fans and being an Oregon Duck. All of this creates a plausible denial that a decision has been made. That said, based on my source, it is obvious that a decision has been made in part because it is so obviously the right decision.
At the March 27 aldermanic meeting, former Ward 3 alderman Greg Roby expressed concern that the Missouri Sunshine Law for public disclosure was violated in regards to Eastman. Golterman said the city followed the law.

"Shawn Michaels, 1997. That's someone who could actually hang with me for 60 minutes, Iron Man Match. Let everyone know who is the best ever, not just best in the world who puts it on a t-shirt or shows up for six months a year. But someone on the roster right now, it would be Tyson Kidd. Me and him go out there and tear it up. Show everyone what wrestling is really about. And still make them care. And have them come away knowing that's the best match they have ever seen."
Larkin, 64, did not return messages seeking comment.

I can't wait to get started, to be honest with you.”

Thonn cites Jacksonville's previous two contests, at Tampa Bay and home against Utah, as potential victories that slipped away in the fourth quarter. The Sharks lost to the Storm, 71-69, and to the Blaze, 75-67.
I am glad to see the Sunpaper via Tim Wheeler has again cast some light on the gas/Marcellus shale exploration and land leasing problems in the western part of our state ("Second thoughts on gas leasing," Jan. 1). It should come as no surprise to us that the drilling operators and contractors refuse to reveal the down side of their operations or the shortcomings of their property leases; one has only to look at our neighbors to the north and what has happened to their water supplies, their roads and streams. If one needs more proof, then look to parts of Texas and Wyoming. It enough to cause us to unleash the dogs when we see a leasing agent at our door.
Tice is under contract through the 2011 season. He could draw ­interest from other teams looking for an ­offensive coordinator, even though he never has held that position.

And yet, that's what Harbach has done with "The Art of Fielding." Centering on an imaginary northern Wisconsin private school and its baseball star-in-the-making Henry Skrimshander, Harbach sidesteps much of the familiar mythmaking that can go along with spinning the American pastime into literature and instead delivers a rich, warmly human story that resonates even if you have no idea what a 6-4-3 double play looks like.

Wind power is a no-brainer, as is requiring all new homes to be built with tankless water heaters, all new large flat roofed buildings to be green and creating green roofs on government buildings —especially schools — wherever feasible.
Small said the agency began by building 300 units of low-cost housing constructed from telephone poles. Small, who bought one of them in the early '60s, says they sold for $16,000 to $20,000. These pole houses, some of which were built on the surrounding hillsides, fared better during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake than more conventional housing, he said.

It's very rare these days for an NFL team to run the ball more often than it passes over the course of a season. But new coach Jeff Fisher's teams did so eight times in 16 seasons in Tennessee and Houston. Usually it was Fisher's worst teams that passed the ball more. In fact, all five of Fisher's losing teams over those 16 seasons threw the ball more often than they ran it.

Taveras took that show to low-A Quad Cities last summer and when he was in the lineup, he hit. He displayed developing power with 27 doubles, 40 extra-base hits (vs. 52 strikeouts) and a .444 on-base percentage. Taveras' .386 average was the highest for a batting champ in that league since 1956. His performance earned him a spot in the elite Arizona Fall League, and the only player younger than him there was Washington National uber-prospect Bryce Harper. One moment in the postseason earned Taveras an admonishment.
With the right investments and environment supporting biomedical innovation, the U.S. research community believes we can stop Alzheimer's by 2020 -- cutting trillions from the 10-year health care tab, sparing millions of Americans the devastation that is Alzheimer's, and reinvigorating the economy with increased productivity and job creation.

But I wouldn't be surprised if closer U.S.-Mexico security ties, likely to be announced during Mexican President Felipe Calderon's visit to the White House on May 19, will eventually drive the drug lords underground, or to move to the next country. It happened in Colombia, and it may happen in Mexico.

A cool head, trial and error, and, yes, time, may salve all. But just in case, city engineers outlined nine alternate north-south routes — roads that used to carry the city's workforce between the suburbs and downtown before the expressway. They even offered turn-by-turn driving instructions.

A meal at the famous News Café (800 Ocean Drive) was on my to-do list, but I wasn't too crazy about fighting for parking and coping with crowds. My solution: An arrival on Ocean Drive at roughly 3:30 a.m., as part of an impromptu all-nighter fueled by foolishness and adrenaline.
Exquisite Corps
Most of the pay limits remain in effect. The Treasury Department set pay limits for GM and Chrysler, and former financial subsidiaries, GMAC, (now Ally Financial), and Chrysler Financial, in exchange for $82 billion in loans from the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
After an overtime loss to the Knicks on the afternoon of April 8, Thibodeau said the team's slow starts in day games "is a big concern." The Bulls missed 11 of their first 12 shots, committed seven first-quarter turnovers and trailed 27-6 in that game.
In 1874, Shay, a former doctor who loved things mechanical, built his first locomotive. Six years later, he sold the construction rights to Lima Machine Works, which provided Shays for virtually every logging railroad in the country. Two similar designs — the Heisler and the Climax (and Cass has examples of both) — provided competition, but not much. With their small wheels and articulation, these geared locomotives could waddle sure-footedly over improvised, ungraded track, around tight curves and up hills that traditional rigid-frame steam locomotives with large driving wheels couldn't begin to tackle. Shays are not fleet of foot, despite the frantic flailing of their vertical pistons, but they are powerful.
Republicans said the apprenticeship language was a sop to unions, though Democrats said 68 percent of the apprenticeship programs in the state are non-union.
In the last two years, I've interviewed more than 20 former call-center workers from several different firms. They told similar stories of how they were trained to deceive. They'd tell consumers that the factory warranties on their cars had expired - when they hadn't - or that their firms were affiliated with an automaker or dealer - which they weren't. All repairs were covered, they told their marks, which they wouldn't be.
Pitino said he also told Izzo that making the leap to the pros isn<U+0092>t a good idea unless you<U+0092>ve already been there as an assistant. Pitino spent two years under Hubie Brown with the New York Knicks.

Prune hybrid-tea roses as they will bloom only on new wood. Cut them back one-third to one-half, leaving canes about 18 inches long. Cut above a swelling bud, pointing out from the center. Remove all suckers and dead wood. Prune climbing roses to remove twiggy growth and weak shoots. Prune canes that flowered last year to three or four buds. Do not prune old garden roses unless you know where to prune. Old garden roses have very individual pruning requirements. Local rose gardens and nurseries offer classes.

When Masini had several popular syndicated TV shows on the air in 1984, he downplayed his creativity, telling the Washington Post: "I work on the premise that there are no new, unique ideas."
“It’s remarkable that the District Attorney’s office has gone ahead with the kind of resources that they need to bring to bear in order to be certain that when there are officers that are engaged in this kind of conduct that they’ll be held accountable,” Spears said. “This is the kind of conduct by police officers that, if goes unchecked, people get killed.”
"She still struggles with the loss as any mother would, but perhaps more than other mothers given the bizarre circumstances she's been confronted with," Roach said. "This is going to be interesting as it unwinds."

As Yao’s shot went up with 0.8 seconds remaining, Roy slapped his hand in what he would later deem a “bonehead” foul. The shot dropped. So did the free throw. And the Rockets inexplicably led 99-98 with 0.8 seconds left. A sellout Rose Garden crowd and a national television audience on TNT was stunned.

If Sandusky is found guilty, then Penn State University was complicit.
But this past game, there was the big tussle after Light shoved Umenyiora over Tuck following a sack by Jason Pierre-Paul. Part of what angered Umenyiora in '07 was how Light shoved him late around piles, which could lead to lower-leg injuries.
But hours before Kasich signed the bill, his gubernatorial campaign issued a far more politically charged statement in a fund-raising appeal.
These mines are very predatory as they are coming into an economically depressed region of the state and making all sorts of promises about the jobs they will create. And I have no doubt that, were they allowed to proceed, they would create jobs. But for how long? And are we really willing to risk the pristine nature of the Boundary Waters and the safety of Lake Superior which is still recovering from the Reserve Mining fiasco for a decade of employment? Tens of thousands of Minnesotans currently make their livings off the tourism trade in Northern Minnesota. I have to believe that the tourism industry will suffer greatly if suddenly our land is ripped bare and our lakes contaminated with runoff sulfuric acid from mines run by people with the worst possible track records.
In response to opponents who say this ordinance will "criminalize homelessness," the fact is that not one Sit & Lie citation has been filed with the Denver County Court since its adoption. This success is due in part to law enforcement and social service providers working together to get these individuals access to the care they need. We firmly believe similar results will be seen through the passage of the unauthorized-camping ordinance.
The Israeli measure would ban the use of models on catwalks or in advertising destined for the Israeli market if they "look underweight" or if their body-mass index falls below 18.5 — the World Health Organization's definition of underweight. If Israeli media outlets alter photographs to make models appear thinner, the measure requires them to disclose that fact.
Curiously, Braque took steps to deny these connections. In 1958 he told Picasso biographer John Richardson that these "Vanitas" pictures actually offered no symbolism; that in presenting the skull and the rosary he had only been "fascinated by the tactile quality of the rosary and the formal problems of mass and composition posed by the skull." Moreover, he said these pictures are "not allusions to the fact that mankind is mortal."
The group started collecting eggs from 20 species in large reef displays in U.S. zoos and aquariums in 2010 and 2011, and has raised six species.

A wastewater treatment plant in New York is offering tours for Valentine's Day, apparently on the theory that nothing says romance like sewage. The plant is offering attendees Hershey's kisses to sweeten the deal. “It’s a unique date, and one they’ll never forget,” the plant boss says in the understatement of the year. We pity your wife, plant boss.
It turns something as basic to childhood as a stroll to school into a power walk. It turns a harmless passerby into a predator. It makes places that appear mundane by day seem threatening in dim light.
"I had to ask myself: Where do we fit in? We decided to do the portraits, and it's been a very emotional experience for us. It's the dignity of it, the looks on their faces when they get that picture. I always feel this is as much for us as for them."

Motte should enter the year with a ton of confidence – no matter what label you hang on him. He had a great regular season and a terrific postseason, allowing just 5 hits and 1 walk in 12-plus innings in very high-pressure situations. And, like a true closer, he bounced back strong from two tough outings in the World Series (Games 2 and 6) to close out Game 7 with a perfect 9th inning. I think he'll be the Cards' best closer since Jason Isringhausen.

Also, Asia's largest budget carrier—with a $3 billion market capitalization—should pick up more passengers as Malaysia Air cuts capacity. Already in the first quarter of 2012, AirAsia's passenger traffic from Malaysia was up 12% compared with last year.

Holdsworth's days are spent aimlessly wheeling a barrow of books up the London streets. He enjoys a minor reputation thanks to "The Anatomy of Ghosts," a book debunking ghostly phenomena he wrote in a fit of rage after Maria desperately tried to contact their dead son using a medium. That book is noticed by Lady Anne Oldershaw, who asks Holdsworth to go to Cambridge and assess her son Frank, a student under doctor's care ever since seeing a friend's dead wife walking the college grounds.

“When it’s right, it’s right ... it must be how Selznick felt when he found Vivien Leigh to play Scarlett O’Hara. You look at someone in the right light, in the right moment and you say, ‘This is it.’ And that’s how it felt with this cast.”
Saariaho's "Orion," heard immediately after intermission, is a 22-minute piece in three movements inspired by the mythical personage of its title, in both his earthly and stellar forms. Its first two movements ("Momento mori" and "Winter Sky") are foggy, surreal and bendy, a steady ticking pulse (set down by harps, percussion, bells) and mechanically reiterated scale passages lending a nervous quality to the prevalent gloom. Low thrums hint at power held in check, but it occasionally comes crashing in waves. This is essentially floating music, galactic, the motion the sparkles of stars.

Last fall Sotheby's and Christie's International auctions for Impressionist, modern and contemporary art did well, a major improvement over comparable May auctions, although not as well as fall 2008.

It was a risk to mess with Wade as he headed for his own free agency, but Riley had been watching and doing research. He knew the three wanted to play together, and he knew he had a glamour destination to offer, a history of success and Wade.

Hayward's early attempts to shift blame to the rig operator, Transocean, failed to take the heat off BP. Later remarks that the amount of oil pouring into the Gulf was "tiny" compared to its volume of water and Hayward's whining that he would "like my life back" made him an object of scorn. That emotion turned to fury when Gulf residents heard that Hayward spent a day at a fancy English sailing race in which his yacht was competing at the height of the disaster.

Ultimately, the real problem isn't impounds but unlicensed drivers.

"Scripts are written — it's not an improvised show," Rich says. "But Armando hires actors who are really smart and funny, and a lot of them have improvisational comedy experience. Julia herself went from Northwestern to Second City early in her career. So, he and his team write the script. But then he gets them on their feet and has the cast, after they do the written script, improvise. And they keep refining the script — it's like putting it in a spin-wash cycle — as the actors add more and more with the improvisation."
His move to the marketplace slightly diminishes the market for the Rams and their control of Griffin or Luck with the No. 2 overall draft picks. Teams that covet RG3 – Washington, in particular – may also covet Manning.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — So the Mets finally get some financial relief, you may think, and they celebrate by investing in a guy who has never posted a major league ERA under 4.20 or thrown more than 173 2/3 innings in a season?
A hearing has been set for February to determine if Rutland will lose his license again. Earlier this year, a judge barred him from performing surgical abortions or delivering babies pending the outcome.

L’Arpeggiata’s “Los Pajardos Perdidos” is a strange bird. Showing the impact of early European musical traditions in South America, the soft thrum of theorbo, baroque harp and harpsichord often attaches to strong rhythms. Director Christina Pluhar guides listeners with a rundown of instruments, dance forms and their origins in the liner notes. In the vigorous “Montilla,” a driving beat tumbles out against wailing vocals. The rapidfire singing in the colorfully orchestrated “El curruchà” also charms. There is striking variety here, including a few selections with a bright sound calling to mind Caribbean music. A contrapuntal prelude by Tarquinio Merlua leads compellingly into a modern song by Adela Gleijer. Among mostly pop-oriented singers, countertenor Phillippe Jaroussky adapts well, sounding fairly natural in folk melodies. He knows how to build intensity throughout a slow-building number. A drawback: A few ballads verge into easy-listening territory, particularly in the verses of the title track, an arrangement of an Astor Piazzolla piece.
That's an unfortunate difference from federal rules for IRAs, which allow you to make a prior-year's contribution up to the tax filing deadline, even if you've already filed your return, Portland tax consultant Joseph Anthony notes.
"It used to be more of a specialized, niche market where you had to be very interested in bird-watching or some kind of nature orientation that made you quite serious in visiting a nature-related place," she said.
Another challenge is that Mataric, Robins and other researchers lack the resources necessary to run the sort of large-scale clinical trials that could answer some key questions: How long do the benefits of therapy last? How do the social skills learned in the lab translate to the real world? Which children are most likely to benefit? And how can researchers design robots to get the best results with the fewest setbacks?
Antimony was measured at 93 parts per million in the hamster's fur and at 106 parts per million in its nose. Both readings exceed the allowable level of 60 parts per million, said O'Rourke, an associate professor of environmental science at the University of California, Berkeley.

Though Avakian did play a big role in those 2007 bills, other legislators and lobbyists pointed out that the Democrats that year gained a majority in both houses for the first time in nearly two decades. As a result, lobbyists were much more willing to cut compromises on the bills, which had strong Democratic backing. And the vocational education bill that Avakian pushed this year contains $2 million, enough to start programs in 10 schools. It's far from certain whether future legislatures will come up with the money to pay for shop in all schools.

And once the error is found and fixed, Das added, the client can save those troubleshooting searches and use them to track ongoing data, in order to prevent the same problem from recurring. Macy's, for example, uses Splunk to monitor its website around the clock and flag potential disk storage problems before they occur, while cellphone carriers use it to see which towers are the busiest and which customers are the heaviest users.

“If you needed something, you could always find her,” says Nina Peskoe Peyser of South Orange, whose mother was a lawyer (and later a judge) when few women worked outside the home. “She would be the go-to person if you fell down and scraped your knee.

Good decision. The 25-minute hike is a little tricky in flip-flops but worth the effort. The fortress, built in 1579 by the Venetians, was used to fight the invading Turks until 1692, according to our Blue Guide. It was later used as a base for pirates (hence the pirate ship in the harbor). You can see why the spot was coveted. It offers 360-degree views of the sea and a prime view of ships crossing from Crete to the island of Antikythera. Today, the distressed walls and tumbledown arches make an ideal place for holiday snapshots.

We began in the Welsh market town of Hay-on-Wye, where it took some willpower to escape into the hills. Hay is home to at least 30 used and specialty bookstores, and its tangled warren of streets is lined with open-air bookcases sagging under the weight of tempting volumes. But any acquisitions would have to ride on our backs for the next 65 miles, so we followed the River Wye out of town, reluctantly unencumbered.

The second half of "Imagine" is devoted to looking at "group creativity," examining what sort of collaborative dynamics (within businesses or communities) tend to maximize innovation. Studies of Broadway musicals by Brian Uzzi, a sociologist at Northwestern University, Lehrer says, showed that relationships among collaborators were one of the most important factors in the success of a show. If team members had too little previous experience working with one another, they struggled to communicate and exchange ideas. But if they were too familiar with one another, fresh ideas tended to be stifled.

Diagnosis of cubital tunnel syndrome begins with a careful history and physical. One must first rule out other causes of nerve symptoms. The causes can include, but are not limited to, stroke, cervical spine injury, spinal cord pathology, intrinsic nerve pathology, dietary deficiency, infectious disease and previous trauma. The patient with cubital tunnel syndrome will often complain of numbness and tingling in the ring and small finger. They may also complain of weakness in the hand. Physical examination will demonstrate decreased sensitivity to touch in the ring and small finger as compared to the index finger. The physician may also be able to detect weakness in the hand and, in long-standing, severe cases, wasting of the small muscles of the hand. The diagnosis may be aided with electrophysiologic studies.

I don't know of any law that dictates what specific questions can be asked in an interview. I believe this idea of what questions should and should not be asked comes from the desire to avoid potential problems if a person is not hired. If the interviewer does not ask age-related questions, then the argument they discriminated based on age is harder to make. I believe the law simply states that companies can't discriminate in their hiring based on age. Therefore, it is wise to avoid any appearance of using age as a factor when interviewing.

A. Out-of-control tomatoes are normal at this time of the year. The hot weather and plenty of moisture have given them a good reason to grow. If you have added extra fertilizer, this is probably helping to produce the lanky, long shoots too. Try keeping liquid feedings to every other week and slow release products to about once a season. Make sure the plants are in the full sun to help keep them as compact as possible. As the cooler fall weather arrives the plants should slow down, fill with shoots and start producing some fruits too.

Although I preferred the pinot grigio with my fish dinner, another diner, who got drafted into our tasting, thought the chardonnay was a better match.

The nation's adolescence is mirrored by Teresita's journey of self-discovery. If "The Hummingbird's Daughter" is the portrait of a young girl burning with the fire of sainthood, "Queen of America" is the story of a saint in exile, coming to terms with the meaning of her powers and finding her place in an unfamiliar society. Near the end of the book - after being feted at the Waldorf Astoria, - Teresita laments the life she left behind, the simple saint she was before all the parties and fancy clothes.

Many factors. The single most important is that the murders were probably the most bizarre in American crime, and people are fascinated by things that are strange and bizarre.

Part of the answer is a bill sponsored by U.S. Sens. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. The Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals (FRAC) Act would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act's definition of "underground injection" to include fluids used for hydraulic fracturing. That would force gas-drilling operations to meet Safe Drinking Water Act standards as well as requiring public disclosure of the chemicals used in the process.

That all accrues in my opinion to President Obama, whom I support and whom I've worked with since he was in the Senate. So to me right now, it looks good. But I don't take it for granted. I think if the Democrats relax and their strategy is these guys will keep messing themselves up, I think that's a poor strategy. I think you prepare for war in a time of peace.
Pacific's partnership with Operation Hope + Financial Beginnings is helping to rectify a deficit of financial education in Washington County by training more volunteer financial educators and deploying them to classrooms and community groups. This fall, Pacific hosted a volunteer workshop that trained 19 new financial educators for Operation Hope + Financial Beginnings.

Following that abandonment often comes a spike in crime, something this ward has become known for. So it's no coincidence that a grass-roots organization looking at vacant properties and their long-term effect on a community held a conference in this part of town to talk about solutions.

Lloyd: I don’t know if the rest world will ever catch up to me because I don’t know where the hell I am most the time. If you notice, almost every TV commercial lately has ukulele in it. The ukulele is now being taken more seriously. It’s not a just novelty instrument or a1920’s nostalgia trip, but an important member of the string family used in classical, jazz, folk, rock, etc. I like Tiny Tim but enough of the “Tiptoe Through the Tulip” requests. That’s like a guitarist getting, “Dude, play Freebird!” (which I get as well). But it’s no surprise to me that more people are getting turned on to the pure sound of the ukulele. That’s why I love it so much - it has a weak sound but in the right hands it can sound powerful. I think because rock music relied so heavily on the guitar, you figure at some point it may have been stretched to the limit. But making folk or orchestra instruments as lead rock instruments could have endless possibilities in that genre. I hope to hear more in the future. As for the Jew’s harp, the other uke player in Lloyd United, Riri Hamilton, plays a mean one.

Moving so quickly required some arm-twisting. The tracks the commission wanted to use were largely under the control of the Santa Fe, Southern Pacific and Union Pacific railroads. Some of the tracks saw little commercial use, but many sections were and remain critically important for transport of cargo to and from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. News reports at the time said the commission resorted to threats of eminent domain, particularly against the economically vulnerable Santa Fe Railroad. In the end, the SCRRA acquired access to almost 500 miles of local track. Some was purchased outright, but much of it came in the form of easements on what are now Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union Pacific lines.

I worked through my share of the novels: "A Farewell to Arms," "For Whom the Bell Tolls." I was compelled, in places, yet still felt distant. Then, on a train from New York to Chicago, I discovered the 1925 collection "In Our Time," Hemingway's American debut. The 15 stories here include some of his most iconic: "Big Two-Hearted River," "The Three-Day Blow," "The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife." These works helped rewire American short fiction with their bluntness, their lack of affect, their insistence that we read between the lines.
The pileup happened on eastbound I-10 near Casa Grande about 11 a.m. and closed both sides of the highway for much of the day.

ø Perhaps the most dramatic political confrontation of Mann's career came in 2005, when he was called to testify before a Congressional committee headed by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, , along with his University of Massachusetts colleague Ray Bradley, who has written about the experience in last year's Global Warming and Political Intimidation: How Politicians Cracked Down on Scientists as the Earth Heated Up. The hearings featured a climate science critic, George Mason University statistician Edward Wegman, who argued that a "clique" of climate scientists controlled the discipline, popularizing the conspiracy theory strain of climate naysaying now often voiced by Inhofe. Wegman's 2008 Computational Statistics and Data Analysis study describing some of this argument was retracted last year, and he was reprimanded by his university this year for scientific misconduct, after it emerged that his team had plagiarized Bradley, Wikipedia and other sources in their efforts.

It happened immediately in the second half. UK freshman big man Anthony Davis finished an alley-oop to start a 13-2 run that demoralized Kansas and infused Kentucky with the confidence to take a 17-point lead at the 10-minute mark. That the Jayhawks became so discombobulated by a quick burst like that was alarming. Only in the final minute did they get the deficit down to single digits.

In 2001, when the Blues swept Dallas to reach the Stanley Cup semifinals, the rating through two games was 9.8.

"The Girl Who Played With Fire," which was directed by Daniel Alfredson from a screenplay by Jonas Frykberg, doesn't have the nuances of its predecessor. It's more of a straight-ahead action saga, although straight ahead is a better description of the hurtling pace than the convoluted plot, which takes all sorts of twists and turns in the present while delving further into the tortured past of its heroine, Lisbeth Salander. If you're resistant to extravagant melodrama, or flat-out horror tropes, you may find the film inferior to "Dragon Tattoo." For my own part, I confess to enjoying the lurid stuff just as much as the dramatic intricacies that reflect the texture of the source. (At least some of the texture; what's decreasingly present in the screen adaptations is Mr. Larsson's moral outrage at what he saw as modern society's pervasive corruption.)

But such judicial review can be time-consuming and expensive.

His incarceration destroyed his finances and subjected his family to the foreclosure of their home. When he was arrested in February 2011 at a BofA branch in Marysville, he said, his 6-year-old daughter watched in horror as her father was handcuffed. He was soon shipped to a federal jail in New Mexico. The soft-spoken Martinez still weeps at the memory of his ordeal.

The shift by the U.S. and its Western and Arab allies toward seeking to sway the military balance in Syria carries regional risks because the crisis there increasingly resembles a proxy conflict that could exacerbate sectarian tensions. The Syrian rebels are overmatched by heavily armed regime forces.
Not surprisingly, chipotles in adobo sauce are wonderful in Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes. Chop them and mix them into shredded cheese for topping nachos. Dice or puree a few to crank up the heat of your favorite chili. Marinate beef strips in the sauce for tacos. Dice them and add to salsa (no cranberries, please).
øTo fill in his roster, Wilson probably will be looking for experienced penalty killers because they were 29th in penalty killing this season. That hurt them in their first-round loss to the St. Louis Blues.

The photography in the mountains is incredible. Who knows how they did it, but the climbs -- and the falls -- certainly look real. Things get less interesting when the chase leads through a festival held in a small Scottish town. But that's OK. By that point, "A Lonely Place to Die" has already reached its greatest heights.

After Lucas’ death, Brian and Nicole became committed to helping spread awareness of EB and to find a way to support the families who are affected.
Top Picks Analysis: General manager Mark Dominik was wheeling and dealing early and often, with the Buccaneers engineering three trades in the opening two rounds to land a trio of good players on the team's radar. Dominik's first order of business was to improve a secondary that was abysmal during last season's four-win disaster, and accomplished that mission by moving down two spots to the No. 7 pick and taking Barron, far and away this draft's best safety. The two-time BCS national champion is both a thumper against the run and an instinctual playmaker with the ball in the air, and his leadership and ability to diagnose the game are obvious pluses as well. Tampa Bay traded up to snare two other possible immediate starters in Martin, a compact and powerful inside runner with good receiving skills and awareness in pass protection who will be given every opportunity to supplant the one-dimensional LeGarrette Blount as the club's top ball-carrier, and the smallish but speedy David. The Florida native is the prototypical Tampa 2 linebacker, possessing the range and quickness to be effective in coverage while able to tackle well in space. He'll be limited strictly to the weak side, however, because of his modest size.
The image sets the tone for the complex, which was first an orphanage for indigent boys, then home to the Royal Conservatory of the Pietà dei Turchini, one of four music schools in Naples that graduated thousands of castrati in the heyday of the Baroque.
THE ANSWER: I think becoming a manager is a process. I managed tasks, then I managed projects, then I would manage groups of projects. Then a business area, then a division, and now I run a company. It's sort of a growing experience. It's something you do over steps. I took management all the way up from a couple of people to lots of people.

What pushes THE FOURTH WAR over the top of being just a mediocre Cold War film are the leads mesmerizing performances. Scheider’s Colonel Knowles visibly teeters on the edge of sanity; his longing for a fight and near childish desire to pick on his enemy shows as plain as day on his face. Likewise, Prochnow’s Valachev is a picture perfect representation of the cold icy enemy Scheider wants to take down. His no nonsense, single-minded determination is the opposite side of the crazy coin shared by his foe. THE FOURTH WAR is an okay, fun little movie on its own, but the director and the lead actors make it something far more enjoyable and engrossing.

Freeman: You've got the credit risk because the government doesn't check your FICO score and other things the way they would on a different type of loan. It's obviously a big market, bigger now than credit cards and auto loans. But now it's adding the interest rate risk, which is that if we say 3.4% student loans are now the new American right, and that's clearly what President Obama wants to do--you look at these speeches he's giving, he talks about it as a necessity, this student funding program. If those--if interest rates--if the government is borrowing at higher rates than they have to offer these kids, then it's a guaranteed loser.
Thus, Ben's alarmism about having to "cast their consciences aside" or "go out of business" <U+0096> is nonsense. As is his worry about cost. It is more cost-effective to cover prevention than the cost of unintended pregnancy and newborn care.

To make it worse, James had turned his ankle and gotten poked in the eye. Mo Williams had committed several poor fouls before fouling out and was unable to take clutch free throws as is his normal role.
No calculation process is going to feel 100 percent fair to every person. If we really want "fair," we should add up the cost of a person's care each year and have him or her pay that amount, selling only catastrophic plans that every man, woman and child would pay exactly the same amount for. When you get groceries, you don't pay 10 cents for a gallon of milk while the guy next in line pays $6. You pay what the people bringing milk from farm to table say it costs to get it there, and then some. We only control how much milk we drink.
The XL expansion would allow the company to pump its heated slurry of sludge-like crude oil and solvent from storage sites near Calgary, Alberta, to refining facilities near Houston and Port Arthur, Texas.

LAKEWOOD, Colo. -- The tooth fairy could soon be out of business. Some families are choosing to have their children’s baby teeth and wisdom teeth pulled so that the dental stem cells can be extracted and frozen.
At its worst, today's big dance music can sound like Air Supply remixed by an automated production plant (i.e. "Save the World," by Swedish House Mafia). French dance producer Martin Solveig's "Hello," best known to most for its use in a chewing gum commercial, is virtually indefensible to anyone interested in non-cheesy music, and he's got a prime time slot in the Sahara tent.

"He was, in my mind, the right back at the right time," said our town's Dan Dierdorf, a Pro Football Hall of Fame offensive tackle. "A lot of Marshall's talent would have been wasted in the 1960s and 1970s. He would have been a good running back. But coaches wouldn't have utilized him to his maximum potential. Before the rules changes and the increased sophistication of the passing game, we never would have seen the best of Marshall Faulk.

"As a 24-year-old JV coach wondering if you could ever be good at this, I would watch them and listen to them. I don't know if they know the effect they had as really being mentors to me at a young age," he said. "The coaches from this league are master educators. They're the kind of guys I want my son playing for. The coaches in this room , they're the kind of guys that make men out of boys and get young people to grow up. Eric is a great example of that."

It could also be because of the next generation of toxic chemicals -- kestrels eat a lot of mice and insects, so they're vulnerable to insecticides and rodenticides.
It is ironic that Minaj, who announced herself to the world as a Day-Glo madwoman unchained, is so willing to subordinate herself to her producers’ demands. The second half of “Roman Reloaded” is thick with glossy dance-pop, much of which feels as if it were written for and rejected by Rihanna. “Spaceships,” “Pound the Alarm,” “Marilyn Monroe” and other tracks shoot for the top of the charts at all costs and leave Minaj, whose placeholder voice will never be confused with that of Lady Gaga, sounding like a bystander on her own work. Occasionally she’ll surface from the mix and get off a bizarre rhymed couplet just to let you know she’s still there. But then another wave of synthesizer smacks her, and she’s swamped again.
By late 2002, his long-distance business was running out of money. Ellis failed to pay the $16,000-a-month rent that November and December for his 10th-floor suite in an Irvine tower.

Jackson's stance on the merit pay provision puts him at odds with fellow Democrat and Senate Minority Leader Capri Cafaro, who called it "an end-around to usurp the will of the people" last week during a news event. Statehouse Democrats are upset about the House's merit pay provision, saying it's too similar to one included in Senate Bill 5, the controversial new collective bargaining law likely to land on the November ballot.

Jordan Hall, Carlos Hyde, Rod Smith and true freshman Bri'onte Dunn, who enrolled early for spring ball, will fight into the fall to see if one really is that kind of back, or if the Buckeyes are better mixing and matching to their different skills. What Meyer and Drayton want to make clear, however, is that if that guy is there, now or on the recruiting trail, they will use him.

As I sat on a bench in this tranquil oasis in the center of the city, I read some notes I'd made while studying the Cosmati floor. It's the only one in the world with an inscription; some of the brass letters have disappeared over the centuries, but the sense is known. First is a date and the name of the artist, then a complicated formula for calculating the end of the world. "A hedge (lives for) three years, add dogs and horses and men, stags and ravens, eagles, enormous whales: each one following triples the years of the one before."

Marking her territory: Caroline explains that husband Al works long hours, so he wanted to get her a guard dog. Al's pal Bernard Kerik has a German shepherd that Caroline always -- wait, Al's best friend is Bernard Kerik? Former New York police commissioner, onetime interim interior minister of Iraq, global risk consultant, and yes, a guy currently facing a panoply of federal charges, including lying to the White House, failing to declare income, filing false returns, and corruption? Turns out Newark-born Kerik and wife Hala, both seen on tonight's episode, live in Franklin Lakes. They accompany Caroline and Al to a training session for their dog. Do not attempt to break into the Manzo home unpadded.

With his relentless emphasis on pacing, Fiennes’ film loses something of the classic’s depth and power; events that should unfold gradually seem to spring to life within moments.

To be sure, not all of those players are missed, but Sanchez's name really stands out. The Giants and their fans have become so exasperated with his never-ending shoulder problems, it's easy to forget that he was the team's best clutch hitter and absolutely perfect for the No. 2 slot in the order.

That sounds like positive news also, the kind of news we all appreciate; but, so the story went, the lower cost for crude could cause the value of the dollar to go down. I'm not sure what that means to my daily life, but it would suggest a dollar would not purchase as much. We've become accustomed to our dollar not buying as much, but to be told declining gas prices could be a cause is a real bummer.

Blue dog blues: Despite the president's political moves toward the middle since November's shellacking -- this week Obama even traveled across Lafayette Park to court an old nemesis, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- these are tough times for moderate Democrats. The Democratic Leadership Conference, the feisty party-within-a-party started by moderates like Bill Clinton after Ronald Reagan's second landslide, just went out of business. And California Rep. Jane Harman is quitting to run a think tank, leaving just 25 Blue Dog Democrats in the House -- there were 54 of the deficit hawks before the GOP wave. Many of the remaining Blue Dogs say they are barely on speaking terms with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

Conway Hill makes some excellent points here about the ways in which track and field insists on making itself incomprehensible to the average fan. In baseball, it doesn't matter whether a guy hits a homer over a 270-foot fence or over a 470-foot fence, It's still a homer. There is no "adjustment" because one fence is closer than the other. Let's face it: there always will be mitigating factors that make one performance different from another. The unnecessarily complicated attempts by track and field's numbers geeks to create a completely level playing field just turn off mainstream fans.

The QuikTrip would be on 2.18 acres at 10776 and 10784 West Florissant. The site, which contains two unoccupied houses, is across from a McDonald's restaurant, just north of a Sonic restaurant and about two blocks from Interstate 270. Otis and Clark Properties has control of the Quik Trip site. St. Louis County tax records say that Schnuck Markets Inc. owns 10776 West Florissant and James Kortkamp of St. Charles owns 10784 West Florissant. In July 1996 the DESCO Group, which is Schnucks real estate development arm, proposed an 800,000-square-foot shopping center that would have included all of Black Oaks. DESCO dropped the project in April 1997 after an anticipated tenant, Home Depot, decided to go elsewhere in Ferguson.

One problem, as you might expect, is that the actors themselves are required to move furniture on and off the stage during scene transitions. Watching the players manually positioning chairs, tables and a small piano repeatedly makes it tough to sustain one's suspension of disbelief.
It may turn out that the availability of land at Aberdeen Proving Ground is a plus, but it was also noted last week that APG has a major drawback insofar as it lacks anything approximating an exit ramp cloverleaf off I-95. Going back a generation to the 1970s when the post was at a high point in tank testing, traffic was notorious in the mornings and evenings as the drag race from the various gates across Aberdeen to I-95 clogged relatively narrow roads. The Route 22-Aberdeen Bypass helped, but even after the RIFs (reductions in force) of the 1980s, the Route 22-Beards Hill Road area remained a place to avoid after about 4:27 p.m. on weekdays.

And it is sickening that Americans for Prosperity would have the nerve to pull this kind of tactic in Delray, part of the Southwest Detroit community that Moroun has treated as an industrial wasteland. The raggedy properties he owns and refuses to maintain in that neighborhood are the foundation for much of the blight that has made Delray such a mess for years and robbed residents of a decent quality of life. Now his surrogates have the nerve to scare residents about someone "taking" their homes?
ø"I did play good on the back," Woods said. "I gave up too many shots on the front nine, though. I didn't get up-and-down a couple times and made a couple bad shots on the wrong side of the hole.

The 76ers displayed much more energy and passion Tuesday night than they did Saturday despite the emotional wave coming from the other side. Derrick Rose's presence at the arena just three days after suffering a postseason-ending ACL tear electrified the crowd and gave the Bulls an early boost.

Still, the addition of three-time Pro Bowl receiver Brandon Marshall ate up quite a bit of salary-cap space for the Bears. He'll count $9.5 million in 2012. The Bears could, however, convert that high base salary into a signing bonus, lower his base salary to the veteran minimum of $715,000 and save about $5.8 million in space. But, the Bears would create problems in 2013, since Marshall's projected base salary is $9.3 million.

Even if you are far from being a Godsmack fan, drummer Shannon Larkin is a one man show and any rock fan or drum fan should see this guy play, it never gets old.

Ecolab Inc. (No. 365) whose annual revenues were $6.8 billion rose 13 spots, but the St. Paul -based company is poised to rise further on Fortune's 2012 list as it fully integrates the acquisition of Nalco, which it acquired in the fourth quarter last year.

There's at least a little political irony at work. During his previous two terms, Kitzhaber faced an often hostile Legislature, which was controlled then by Republicans. This time, it's his own party giving him heartburn.
Hayes met Kitzhaber during her uphill race against then-Republican Rep. Ben Westlund. Kitzhaber, ending his first two terms as governor, appeared at a campaign event for her.

Sean Meagher: This was the LaMarcus Aldridge we were all waiting for. The LaMarcus Aldridge Nate McMillan knew he could be. He carried the Blazers during long stretches when this team could have completely sank. His numbers during January and February speak for themselves and reflect the determination and dedication Aldridge has to being a top tier player in the NBA. He proved he can be a No. 1 option for the Blazers. He dragged a bit down the stretch due to playing heavy minutes, more than a handful of games at center, and, unlike some at his position, defense along with his offense. It'll be interesting to see what he has planned for improving this summer and if Rich Cho can get him some help off the bench.
June's audit found that victims of sexual assault in Portland face one obstacle after another, from the initial 9-1-1 call to their hospital exams to interviews with detectives.

When you meet in a public place, you can never prepare enough. Some places just don't lend themselves to good business conversations. I'd pick a quiet coffeehouse to meet at, only to find out that kids like to stop by for their afternoon sugar rush, at the same time I scheduled a meeting with a client.

North Carolina already outlaws gay marriage, but adding that ban to the state constitution would make it much harder to change in the future. Opponents to the amendment argue the language is vague and it could have wider consequences beyond those for gay couples.

Presumably, Marra would work with that group should he stay, and Eaton would be part of it if he remains in Eugene after turning professional.
Top Picks Analysis: The Cowboys made one of this draft's boldest moves by shipping their No. 14 overall pick and second-rounder to St. Louis to garner Claiborne, widely regarded as this year's premier cover cornerback. The 2011 Thorpe Award honoree boasts the arm length to efficiently jam receivers at the line of scrimmage as well as the fluidity to mirror opponents down the field, and should instantly upgrade a secondary that was a big sore spot last season. Dallas didn't stop there in its quest to bolster the defense, spending its next three selections on that side of the ball. Crawford isn't much of a pass rusher at this stage, but has the functional strength to contribute as a rotational end in Rob Ryan's 3-4 scheme, while Wilber is a quality athlete with the movement skills to possibly take over for Anthony Spencer if the latter departs as a free agent after this season.

Teixeira is now 11-for-22 (.500) with seven home runs against Chen. "It's really all about that I see him well," Teixeira said. "It doesn't matter if they throw it right down the middle.

The latest cuts, to be aired at a hearing next Wednesday, are hardly subtle. They include elimination of the MAX free rail zone downtown -- a step that completes the dismantling of the once-remarkable Fareless Square, following last year's elimination of free bus rides in it.

Gaylen: We went over to Vancouver and we got married. You didn't have to be 21. We had a date at 4:30 for her cousin to be a witness, and her boyfriend. So we get over there, but Tom, the boyfriend, he doesn't show up. The Justice of the Peace comes out and says, "In 15 minutes I'm going home. You've got to have another witness."

Stops 9 through 12 are really more about Old New York than the Titanic, but survivors could have dined at the Old Homestead Steakhouse on 9th Avenue near 14th Street (which claims a history back to the 1860s but shows no nostalgia in its sleek dining room) or had a drink at McSorley's Old Ale House, which opened on East 7th Street in 1854. McSorley's walls, crowded with memorabilia, include a New York Times "Titanic Sinks" front page. And if the Strauses had survived, I suppose they might have gone (as I did) for a pastrami sandwich at Katz's Delicatessen. Katz's, which opened in 1888, may be best known these days as the setting for the "I'll have what she's having" scene in the 1989 movie "When Harry Met Sally."

They're also growing quite accustomed to playing tight ones: 10 of their 11 playoff games have been decided by one goal, and only once has Washington scored as many as four. It's quite a long way from when they were winning playoff games by scores of 4-0 or 5-3 - and, incidentally, never making it beyond the second round.

This work gives me everything. It has given me a real reason to live. I have goals for the animals that sometimes seem insurmountable. I've been able to get one federal bill passed in Washington to stop the interstate traffic of big cats. I co-authored the bill and took it to my congressmen. I don't know how anyone can have lions and tigers as pets. They are predators. Our government says it's OK to breed these animals and sell them. My goal is to get a billed passed to stop the breeding. So many adults and children are either killed or injured by these animals. It's totally our fault.

Most hospitals and clinics these days have pretty homey birthing centers with couches and flat-screen TVs. They're still medical facilities, and they won't be as familiar -- or as private -- as your home. Some research shows that for low-risk pregnancies (her doctor will tell you whether she fits into this category), home births can be just as safe as hospital births. In fact, at home, there may actually be less likelihood of labor induction, medication, episiotomy and c-section. The operative phrase here is "low-risk," which will be determined by her age, health, and whether she has or has had any health issues or other risk factors that might require medical intervention.

Then she started spending the rest of her life trying to prove how irresistible she was, going after only men who were taken - men for whom she had absolutely no desire - just to see if she was enticing enough to pry them away from their women and into her bed. All she wanted to do was prey on married men to test her wow-power. There was no pleasure. She was just adding another notch to her non-chastity belt.

So, for instance, this could mean encouraging a Christian gay man who wants to stay faithfully married to his wife to be open with her about his orientation, and develop strategies for not becoming involved with men.

Americans were not always so myopic that they saw the world through the cross hairs of their rifle sights. During the depression of 1892 to 1896, unemployed workers marched to Washington by the thousands in what was then the largest mass protest this country had seen. In 1932, even more jobless people -- 25,000 -- staged what was, at that time, the largest march on Washington, demanding public works jobs and a hike in the inheritance tax. From the '60s to the '80s, Americans marched again and again -- peacefully, nonviolently and by the hundreds of thousands -- for civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, economic justice and against wars. In fact, this has been a major focus of Piven's scholarly work over the years -- the American tradition of protest and resistance to economic injustice -- and it's a big enough subject to keep hundreds of academics busy for life.

Some of the recommendations would take effect immediately, such as allowing eighth-graders who are not enrolled at a magnet school to select any of the district's four comprehensive high schools regardless of where they live.

The recent letter from R. Smith ("The flawed arguments against same-sex marriage," Feb. 6) is false and disingenuous. The logic is fallacious because the examples do not define the object, in this case the Biblical definition of marriage.

On the Pats’ first offensive series after their back-to-back touchdowns, Fewell called a pair of three-man rushes. (This was after Grant contained the pitch play on first down, by the way.)

One play later, another three-man rush meant eight dropped to cover. Brady again found no one and, 4.1 seconds after the snap, first contact was made by DE Dave Tollefson. Tuck then charged from his linebacker spot and pounced on Brady to finish the sack.

But think of it this way: On a planet of 6 billion people, only about 6 million of us -- a minuscule 0.1 percent -- get to claim the revered, if ambiguous, title of Hoosier. So embrace it -- and embrace living here, even if many of our politicians have trouble doing so these days.

Mizzou broke what didn't need fixing. I can understand the insecurity about the helmet logo, but overhauling what I considered a mostly cool look seems extreme. Of course, those who don't like the look are told they don't "get it" because the approach is tailored to impressionable teens. Amazing what institutions of higher learning come up with to justify greater revenue streams. Last time I checked, Alabama had one of the least hip uniforms in the nation. Somehow, it doesn't seem to have affected recruiting. If a program truly believes uniforms will make a difference in its recruiting, then its success is more superficial than most would care to admit. Truman gets a thumbs down on this one.

Though recognizing how abundant the blue catfish have become in Maryland waters, DNR Fisheries Service director Tom O'Connell said, "We don't want to encourage the development and spread of this species. As top predators, they are a serious threat to native species, which provide ecological and economic benefits to the region."

Roam delivers good value, but I must say the burger prices can send the eyebrows up. The elk burger runs $18 — OK, game meat and all that — but a basic beef burger costs $16. Even a veggie burger is $15. Those are Manhattan prices, and seem out of line with the rest of the menu.

Eventually, the conversation veered toward other topics, and I asked McMillan if, with the Blazers about to start their second back-to-back-to-back of the season, he had considered anything outside the box. Would he ever consider do something crazy like playing his reserves for the entire second half?
Next-door to Callaghan, it's one of the few houses that occasionally offer sparkling wine. Plans are to salvage fruit from hail-damaged vines to make a sparkling wine or a rosé.

But Obama has come under fire from Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina for his frequent use of another oddity of Illinois politics: voting "present" rather than casting up-or-down votes on controversial measures.
The debates push us in different ways. We've heard candidates charge that all Muslims are extremists, and pundits discuss whether Mormons are Christians. I suspect those remarks sent more than one adult Sunday school teacher to a church library searching for answers. Meanwhile, retired guys drinking coffee at McDonald's kibitz about birth control, while religious leaders testify in Congress. Parents of grade school kids hold family meetings to discuss why a teacher was dismissed for getting married, while states vote to authorize gay marriage.
A study by Bankrate.com this week found that just 45 percent of checking accounts are now free with no strings attached, down from 65 percent last year and 76 percent in 2009. Customers can still get free checking in most cases, but only if they meet certain conditions, such as setting up direct deposit.
PD: Speaking of confidence: Chmerkovskiy took some hits this past season for projecting egoism and arrogance. Is he as cocky as he seems?
Ryan is the point man in the new House GOP majority's drive to rein in spending and bring the budget closer to balance. Tuesday's speech was the highest profile assignment yet for a wonky former congressional staff aide who has evolved into one of his party's brightest stars.
The committee’s creation comes amid demands for action following a series of Star-Ledger reports showing that hundreds of New Jersey officers and firefighters obtained steroids and human growth hormone from a Jersey City doctor who frequently broke the law by prescribing the drugs when they weren’t medically necessary.

His motive, they said, was born out of "intense personal and professional pressure." He had devoted his entire 20-year career to the anthrax vaccine program, and feared that the project was being phased out. "Following the anthrax attacks, however, his program was suddenly rejuvenated," authorities said.

The original blueprints called for Saul to be installed 10 feet away from the west wall. Burgard took one look and decided, like a spouse inspecting the living room upon the arrival of the new sofa, that 10 feet from the wall was too close -- the royal posterior would be crowding a large landscape painting intended to be hung just behind.
A representative of Santorum's campaign could not immediately be reached for comment.

The story could be found in the stands. Aldridge's mother, Georgia, was at the Rose Garden. Usually she'll pick spots on the schedule when the Trail Blazers have a cluster of home games and leave her home in Dallas to come watch her son play. The Heat game was her first of the season. Traveling has become much more difficult.

Holliday threw a runner out at the plate to end the fourth inning. Freese raced home from second base on Molina's two-out single in the fourth. Craig showed enough plate discipline to work a bases-loaded walk off side-arming reliever Brad Ziegler.
Finally, the argument that Big Labor in Ohio is tapped out after spending $40 million in the last election is simply wishful thinking. A ton of the money spent to beat Issue 2 came from outside of Ohio, and there's plenty more where that came from. As long as people are forced to join unions, the supply of money Big Labor can throw at its political emergencies is, for all intents and purposes, inexhaustible.

"One option would be to totally scrap the current tax code in favor of a flat tax, and thereby make taxation much simpler, easier to follow and harder to manipulate," Perry writes in his book. "Another option would be to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution (which authorizes the taxation of income) altogether, and then pursue an alternative model of taxation such as a national sales tax or the Fair Tax."

I have loved fashion all of my life. When I was 6, my mother gave me sketchbooks. I drew pictures of clothing; I wanted to be a fashion designer. I could wear whatever I liked behind the doors of my house, but when I went to school I had to adapt, be like everyone else, not stand out. My mom is my angel. She is down to earth and so supportive of me. That is what's important.

Republicans, who have the better arguments on the merits of the pipeline, have unfortunately exaggerated the likely number of jobs it would create and even portrayed it as essential to economic recovery.
Let me say that I think many of Lee's initiatives are good ones. Beyond some of the tax exemptions, he's hired a chief innovation officer, partnered with companies like Zynga to create tech job-training programs, and announced an "Innovation Portfolio" to find creative ways to get tech companies to help the city solve some of its most pressing challenges.
Riverside County's jails are allowed to hold 3,906 people, and not one inmate more. Whenever the sheriff's office exceeds that limit, set by a federal court order, the agency must release inmates and detainees awaiting trial.

Georgia now spends more than $1 billion a year on state prisons and has seen its inmate population double in the past 20 years. A special council of legislators, judges and other officials determined the state can save money by removing some nonviolent offenders from prison. It has recommended changes in sentencing for some low-level offenders and beefing up alternatives to prisons, such as drug, mental health and veterans’ courts.

Buffalo receiver Steve Johnson apologized for a touchdown celebration against the Jets in which he pretended to shoot himself in the leg, a la Jets receiver Plaxico Burress in a New York nightclub a few years back. Johnson also mimicked Santonio Holmes' "airplane" TD celebration in which he glides around the end zone with arms outstretched like airplane wings. In Johnson's rendition, the plane crashed.

The school board, saying it is "erring on the side of caution," adopted a policy this month prohibiting commercial microwave technology sites and will oppose those proposed for sites adjacent to school boundaries.
Weekend ride
Linda Wilson: It is certainly not a conspiracy with a gas station. It is simply just how we had to reduce the lanes coming off the interstate back into the existing number of lanes on First Capitol. The lanes couldn't be extended any further. There are the appropriate signs and stripes out there, but I will have our traffic engineer check it to see if anything else could be added. Sometimes it's a space issue to be able to add more signs.
"The difference was just Anthony Davis will be the No. 1 player picked in the draft," said Louisville coach Rick Pitino after losing to Kentucky, 69-61. "When you're playing against Bill Russell at the pro level, you realize why the Celtics won 11 world championships. When you see this young man at the collegiate level, you realize why they're so good. He's so much a factor."
I hesitated, then pulled off in pursuit of my own space. Something didn't feel right. I was born in the country – the country of Columbus, Ohio – but I recognize a city slicker when I see one. I also know that there is no such thing as a free parking lot in downtown Cleveland.
Colorado State stacks up well in nearly all of the categories. Its road record — 3-9 overall, 1-6 in MW play — is cause for concern, however.

It worked in practice. So Harrison had Black listen to the metronome as she warmed up before the 200 last week at the Big Sky Indoor Championships in Pocatello, Idaho. Black, who won the Big Sky 60 meters, shaved a second off her personal record in the 200 and placed fourth.
Aside from Apple, much of the valley struggled in 2011 with an on-again, off-again global economy. The year started strong, after a record-setting 2010, as tech spending bounced back from the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. But then the debt crisis worsened in Europe, and U.S. lawmakers seemed unable to resolve a deficit standoff.

The Modoc bands who resisted settling on the reservation weren't simple stereotypes of victims or heroes. "They were real people," she says, "who under the circumstances made good and bad decisions, as anybody would."
No doubt there was a dark side to Seau, 43, a nasty streak that got him in trouble with the law a couple of times, most recently in October 2010, when he drove his Cadillac Escalade over a cliff in Carlsbad, Calif., after being arrested for assaulting his 25-year-old galpal.
That one-point advantage was the only lead the Badgers could manage and when 6-foot-5 Jason Brown fouled out with 1:56 remaining, Christian gained the upper hand inside.

But the uptick in late payments during the fourth quarter, and an increase in the average balance to $5,204, from $4,965 a year prior, indicates a return to seasonal patterns seen before the recession. Holiday spending leads some card holders to put off paying their bills. If the seasonal patterns continue, the late payment rate will fall as individuals receive tax refunds and use that money to bring their accounts current.
There was plenty of occasion for SLU to smile after this one. Other than its typical shooting struggles in the first half on some pretty makeable shots - "If we were really good and there was a big line on this game in Las Vegas, there would be an investigation," SLU coach Rick Majerus said - SLU took care of business against one of the league's lesser teams for its sixth straight win and ninth in its past 10 games. The Billikens (22-5, 10-3) remain in second place in the Atlantic 10, half a game behind Temple, and are moving ever closer to their first NCAA trip in 12 years. It was SLU's 10th win by 20 or more points, its most in one season, and, though this year's team has the advantage of a longer season, matches the school record for wins in the regular season.

‘‘I kind of like it, to be honest,'' Self said. ‘‘We've been the hunted, it seems like, for a while. I don't know if you're a serious underdog when you've won 31 games and won your league.

Even if he’s able to withstand the blister, it might present an opportunity for the Red Sox to skip Buchholz’ next start, give him a chance to throw an extra bullpen session and plug Cook into the rotation rather than putting him in the bullpen.
In the 1920s, a group of Baltimore citizens rallied to save the Phoenix Shot Tower from being demolished to make way for a gas station. At that time, the structure was privately owned, and in one of Baltimore's earliest historic preservation efforts, the group raised more than $20,000, bought the tower and then donated it to the city. Nearly 100 years ago, these people had the foresight and determination to give us a great gift that has become a Baltimore icon. Today, we are the stewards of the Shot Tower and many other great historic places. We now have the chance, and the obligation, to employ the same creativity and determination to make sure these places remain for future Baltimoreans to enjoy.

For most scotch drinkers, it's new single-malt releases, not blended scotch, that are cause for excitement. After all, single malts are exclusive by nature, showcasing a particular blend of ingredients barrel-aged in a particular environment for a particular number of years.

2. Buddy Dyer. Considering that nine months ago, the Orlando mayor was turning himself in at the Orange County Jail, it's somewhat remarkable to see him on this list at all. The scuttled effort to charge him with obscure and previously ignored campaign crimes obviously rattled Dyer, 47. But after treading lightly for his first few months back in office, he re-emerged with force. He is largely credited with changing the skyline of downtown Orlando and invigorating the area with an increasingly wealthy class of people living there. His ambitious goals now include renovating the TD Waterhouse Centre and Citrus Bowl, and building a performing-arts center. It's a lot to bite off. But our panelists respect him for trying and have kept him in second place.

About 100 California chefs signed a petition Monday asking to keep the duck- and goose-liver delicacy legal with additional regulations. But no lawmaker has offered to take up their cause and sponsor a bill to overturn the 2004 law establishing the ban, which is scheduled to take effect July 1.
About the Mavericks: Dallas has been one of the most consistent teams this season and is one of the hottest in the Western Conference right now, having won 20 of its last 24 games. Three of those losses were decided by one point. ... Dallas went 11-1 in February, averaging 108.9 points per game and shooting 50.4 percent from the field. ... But the Mavericks have revealed weaknesses lately, suffering three losses in their last five games. ... All have come against Western Conference playoff contenders — the Memphis Grizzlies, the New Orleans Hornets and, most recently, the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers beat the Mavericks 96-91 Saturday, moving within a half-game of second place in the West. ... The key number to beating the Mavericks is 100. They are 36-3 when they score at least 100 points, but are just 11-16 when they score less than 100. Dallas has failed to reach triple-digits in two of the last three games and lost both times. ... The Mavericks went 4-of-16 from three-point range against the Lakers in Saturday's loss. It snapped a streak of 35 consecutive games with at least six three-pointers made, which was the third-longest single-season streak in NBA history. ... Nowitzki, who ranks 10th in the NBA in scoring, had 25 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in the loss to the Lakers. It was his 11th double-double this season.

“It’s been a dream of mine,” Barron said. “With Miami, (I) made the playoffs a couple years, but wasn’t even on the playoff roster. But it was still amazing to be there and to feel the excitement every time the ball was thrown up. To be in the arena. I was like, ‘Man, one day, hopefully i can get back out there an have a jersey on, get up and down and play in the playoffs.’ So now I think that opportunity is pretty close; it’s in reach. Hopefully ... I can get out there and be able to produce and help out.”
“The number of people quitting their jobs is on the rise, with nearly 1.9 million workers doing so in January. While many might be emboldened by Mr. Smith’s public outing of his former employer to exit in a similar fashion, it is important to remember that most workers do not have the benefit of Smith’s former high-level position and salary.

Michigan player who must be locked down: PG Trey Burke (14.8 ppg, 4.6 apg) has become the key to just about everything Michigan does in Beilein's intricate offense.

Think about this in relation to the Wallace piece and what emerges is a larger argument about depth and superficiality and the difficulty of having feelings, issues that inform Franzen's fiction as well.

We feel for the Obama administration over these early gift issues. Who hasn't been there, right? Maybe we never gave Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov a red plastic button that said "overcharge" instead of "reset," but is there anyone who hasn't given at least one lame present? (Otherwise, who's buying all those hideous neckties?) We like the iPod, and the queen is known to like show tunes. Anyway, we believe it's the thought that counts. We believed that when former Prime Minister Tony Blair gave President Bush a sweater in 2006 and Bush said it was "awfully thoughtful." Obama said he was delighted with the queen's gift: a picture of herself with the Duke of Edinburgh.

I couldn't disagree more. I think teachers and police officers and firefighters are part of what keep America strong.

A: Actually, my respiration has been fine throughout this process. The difference was there was a five-game losing streak last season, a response, and then restored confidence. But now, this malaise, especially on the road, has been ongoing for a month. That's a pretty long period of mediocrity in a relatively short season.

Step three: Make a travel clinic appointment early.

Under the plea deal described in the media reports, Urdangarin would agree to plead guilty on condition prosecutors not seek a jail term of more than two years.

Hey, Mary Kay: It is infuriating that the Browns might be thinking about bringing Payton Hillis back. Not because he could possibly be a really good player for a position we are lacking at, but because all the drama could have been avoided. I don't buy the injury nonsense ... he could have developed a chemistry with Shurmur, and the fans that turned on him could still be fans. We could have had at least one position with some sort of consistency instead of the disaster that ensued. Why is there no criticism for another wasted year? First Mangini and now possibly Hillis.

... a physical beast at 6-foot-2, 235 pounds, and one evaluator compared his power to that of Russell Branyan, another south Georgia lefthanded hitter. Green was dominating and putting on huge power displays against modest pitching, pushing himself into first-round consideration. However, scouts who saw him last summer recall he struggled mightily with velocity at the East Coast Pro Showcase. Greene is somewhat stiff but is an average runner, which should give him a chance to play left field, but some scouts think he'll wind up as more of a first base/DH type.

DeLillo is among the most consistent of writers; his books are like installments in one ongoing novel, an inquiry into the confusion and intractability of contemporary life. What seemed, at one time, prescient — the tension between pop idolatry and rock 'n' roll iconoclasm that marks "Great Jones Street" (1973), the recognition of extremism as a social force in "Players" (1977) and "Running Dog" (1978) — has become common currency.
"If our voices are silent, that harms residents," said Brian Dunlap, secretary/treasurer for the firefighters group. "A doctor is an advocate for a patient like we're an advocate for the people in our communities.
Time was, during Republican James Rhodes' governorships (1963-71, 1975-83), when new GOP talent wasn't really brought along. Now, with Batchelder's House caucus and a set of Republican statewide elected executive officers ranging in age from 33 (Treasurer Josh Mandel) to 64 (Attorney General Mike DeWine, a former lieutenant governor and U.S. senator), Republicans have a deep bench.

"They can do meaningful journalism," Steele said. "Their process is not as substantive as it should be regarding sourcing. They often use unattributed sources in their reporting, and that is problematic. It diminishes the accuracy of a story. You run the risk that unattributed sources won't hold the truth."

In a rare move, Sotheby's sent the work to private homes in Asia, North America and Europe so key clients could test whether the haunting image clashed with the rest of their art collections.

But today, the building is an adventure for young creative minds.
The state's Republican-controlled Legislature recently passed a bill that will independently audit the state's managed-care companies. It's a good step, but the audits won't begin until 2014. That's a long time to wait for independent answers about whether the state has systematically overpaid plans and whether the recently announced $73 million in givebacks by Minnesota's big plans is sufficient.

Although the pub and restaurant had been going strong for decades, current owners Mike Coakley and Corey Weinfurt brought brewing back into the mix in 2005, reviving the original purpose of the complex of buildings and cellars built in 1842 by German immigrant John Georgian.

But a funny thing happened last year. Cabrera signed with the Royals in a move that went pretty much under the radar. Then he went out and tore it up. A career-best .305 average and .809 OPS. He hit 18 home runs in spacious Kauffman Stadium and drove in 87 runs.
Bettencourt has developed relationships with the Environmental Defense Fund and Nature Conservancy and embraced a controversial new quota system for catching petrale sole and other bottom-feeding fish. That puts him at odds with both old-school fishermen who distrust environmentalists and some captains of small boats who feel the quota system is exclusionary and leads to consolidation within the fleet.
Junior Seau's brain will be donated by his family for research into football-related head injuries.
The annual musical always attracts big crowds to the school. Last year’s production of “High School Musical” resulted in three sellouts of the six performances.

"We have to demonstrate that we are serious about fixing our broken immigration system, we have to secure the border, we have to enforce our laws, and then I think the natural compassion of the American people will kick in, and they'll let us deal with these sympathetic situations like these kids who are not culpable, but were brought here by their parents and find themselves at a dead end," Cornyn said.

MESSING: Probably not, because (this statute) likely applies only to smuggling offenses and concealing aliens in the process of being smuggled from law enforcement. Transportation of an undocumented relative to church is likely outside the scope of the kind of transportation contemplated by the statute, but the point will have to be settled finally by the appellate courts. Federal courts, in interpreting similar federal statutes from which the language of the Arizona statute was derived, generally have not applied the laws to transportation of aliens in a non-smuggling social context, but the federal appellate themselves are not in total agreement on this point.

In his previous four trips Down Under, Tsonga has beaten Rafael Nadal (2008) and Novak Djokovic (2010), but neither victory paved the way to the title. He ended the 2011 season in the Top 10 for third time in four years and qualified for the World Tour Finals, where he lost the final to Federer. Tsonga is widely considered the most dangerous player outside the top four due to his ability to get up for the big matches.

Maybe because the recession revealed a major blind spot in our smart-growth strategy: Making stuff look good, making neighborhoods more livable, does not automatically translate into job creation. If you need proof that urban renewal isn't enough, stay aboard the streetcar as it winds down to South Waterfront, where high-priced condos have been downgraded to affordable apartments and promised high-tech jobs haven't materialized.

Craig reread Bond novels as part of his preparation for "Skyfall," and a delay in film production, caused when studio MGM filed for bankruptcy in 2010, allowed him more time to discuss the character with Mendes.
When the restaurant opened, plates were set before diners in unison. On my recent return visit, our first course was brought by one person, who put the wrong dishes in front of us. The sommelier poured the wine and then asked if it was too warm. It was, and should never have been served at that temperature - especially in a place where the wine list is so expensive.

--Peruse plenty of places. Miller of LivingSocial says deal hounds will check 18 to 23 sites in the course of their research. All three experts suggested looking at the sites they work for, of course, but they also suggested Airfarewatchdog.com, Yapta.com, Kayak.com (an airfare aggregator),Priceline.comand BiddingforTravel.com, which can help guide you before you place you bid; Homeexchange.com (for house swapping); VRBO.com (vacation rental by owner); and FlyerTalk.com (good for info on rewards programs). To their list I would add SmarterTravel.com, CruiseCompete.com and WhichBudget.com (with a thank you to Kiplinger's for calling out this site, which compares prices for airfares within Europe).

This seems like a familiar movie gambit (shades of Stephen King’s “Misery”), but it’s a conceptual idea with some depth. The movie credits Poe as the godfather of much morbid popular culture, and is correct to do so. There would be no “CSI” anything without Poe (who knew the corpse was as much subject as object), or “Saw,” or Hannibal Lecter (also a Baltimore guy). The killer fancies himself a Poe devotee, so it’s as though Poe is being stalked by a twisted version of his own legacy, somebody who copies Poe’s gruesome mechanics but misses the layer of florid romantic feeling.

That impulsiveness was my undoing. Had I stopped to think, I would have at least put on some gloves and spent a few minutes scanning the shrub carefully before making any cuts.

A HARD REALITY
To determine the investment allocation that's appropriate for you, you must first make a good assessment of your risk profile, investment objectives and liquidity needs. Are you looking for long-term results or short-term gains? Do you have an emergency fund? Are you saving for retirement or shorter-term goals? Do you have adequate insurance coverage? Do you have the temperament to handle the volatility that comes with investing in the stock market?

I tried other websites, starting with AARP. The site directs consumers to an AARP-branded Aetna plan. I entered my ZIP code and got the same response: the plan was "not available in your area." Next, at a top-rated insurance broker site, my ZIP code brought up one result. The $561-a-month GHI policy covered annual physical and gynecologic exams, prescription drugs with a co-pay, hospitalization and outpatient surgery. But it did not cover, among other things, any other office visits; inpatient physical therapy; ER professional charges; diagnostic admissions; and diagnostic lab tests. To me, that seems like too much money to spend for what amounts to catastrophic coverage.

A little more than two weeks before the midterm elections, investments by GOP-aligned groups appear on the verge of bearing fruit. Party strategists agree that Republicans will gain seats in the Senate, controlled now by Democrats, 59-41, including the two independents who caucus with Democrats. While capturing control of the Senate remains a possibility, the GOP is more likely to gain the 39 seats it would take to win back the House, polls and party strategists suggest.
"It's much broader than I could support," Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said on MSNBC just after announcing she was dropping her re-election bid.

The grass is thigh high. Here is a striped golf ball, forgotten and mud-dimpled, a Top Flite XL Super Range. Sold by the bucket to practicing duffers, smacked into oblivion, retrieved and sold again. Deep in the weeds are a pair of toppled yardage signs, 100 and 125. Directly east from the covered hitting area, about pitching wedge distance out, rainwater finds a depression and forms a knee-deep pond 50 feet across. A dozen ducks rise and fly south in a burst of disturbed water, angry quacks and whirring wings. Narrow animal trails crisscross the property; neighbors think coyotes patrol it.

lyrics. It's everywhere, and I especially feel that because I spend so much time on campuses. Young women just have much better (bull) detectors than we ever had. It's also true that women get more activist and radical with age. Our pattern of activism is in general the reverse of men. Men tend to be rebellious in youth; they get more conservative with age because they gain power. Women are more conservative in youth and get more radicalized with age because we lose power.

In the 1980s as now, the question arose: If you were eating City Restaurant's spicy Thai duck curry, how was it different from the duck curry you could get at the Thai restaurant up the street? Short answer: It wasn't. As in the best restaurants in Thai Town, the curry was made from scratch, using then-rare ingredients like kaffir lime and fresh turmeric, and the ducks may well have come from the same farm. The grilled Japanese eggplant that was a major component of the dish was as fragrant and pudding-like as it would have been at a restaurant like Jitlada. It wasn't a riff on Thai duck curry, a fantasy on a theme of Thai duck curry or a chiefly re-imagining of Thai duck curry — it was a Thai duck curry, and a pretty good one.

"Yeah, you learn that one real quick," Smith said with a chuckle. "It's tough. Even look at Sam a year ago, everybody is singing your praises, and then a year later all of the sudden it's not the same story. You learn how quickly things can change and obviously this is the most popular sport in America and it is that for a reason. Obviously, that's a part of it. If you play quarterback, you're going to be under a lot of scrutiny, people are going to say a lot of things either way about you, so you better have some thick skin. If you don't have thick skin you're not going to make it very long in this league."

Gov. John Kasich's proposed budget would slice local government funds by 25 percent this year and 50 percent next year. That will put nearly 30 percent of the state's 5,600 government entities at risk of falling into fiscal watch or fiscal emergency, Yost said.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Finding herself with a bit of time on her hands, Justice Ginsburg swung by Cairo last month to help out the lads from the Muslim Brotherhood building the new Egypt: "I would not look to the United States Constitution if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012," she advised them.

It is far from clear that the creditors' maneuver will work, legal experts say. But defendants warn that if Aurelius and its allies prevail, markets that depend on the sanctity of a settled transaction could be disrupted by making it difficult for investors to assess the risk inherent in participating in an LBO.

Mr. Kotkin, one of the nation's premier demographers, left his native New York City in 1971 to enroll at the University of California, Berkeley. The state was a far-out paradise for hipsters who had grown up listening to the Mamas & the Papas' iconic "California Dreamin'" and the Beach Boys' "California Girls." But it also attracted young, ambitious people "who had a lot of dreams, wanted to build big companies." Think Intel, Apple and Hewlett-Packard.

Everybody has a special place where time stands still and serendipity rules. Mine is a giant granite cathedral decorated with some of the tallest waterfalls in the world.

A mighty river flows through it, and a magical range of light illuminates all of its features. I'm talking about Yosemite National Park.
But there are older artists here, too. Red Krayola, the Texas rock band (founded in 1966, thank you very much) is performing, and one gallery is actually devoted to a dead artist, Forrest Bess, who died in 1977. Bess was a regular at the Betty Parsons gallery from 1949-67, but his day job was bait fishing off the Gulf coast of Texas; he’d met Parsons in ’48 and charmed her with his art, paintings, mostly, with some collage. Bess had some unusual ideas about sexuality that he thought his paintings illustrated, but Parsons would never let him explain those theories in wall texts. So the Biennial has given Los Angeles artist Robert Gober (he of the realistic clothed human leg sticking straight out of the wall) an entire room to finally give Bess his full due.

Room 77 (www.room77.com) has added a price search function to its unique (as far as I know) individual room locator capability. Since its inception, Room 77 has featured hotel floor maps showing the location of individual rooms, and its "room concierge" function lets you identify and request a room in a location you prefer -- high floor, view, quiet, whatever you want. The new price comparison function is extremely fast; it searches among the big online agencies that usually have the best available rates and it usually matches the lowest price it finds on other sites. One thing that stands out when you use Room 77 is how often the big online agency prices are identical or within a dollar of each other. Except for the "opaque" sites, it is becoming increasingly obvious that no individual site can really beat its competitors by a significant amount.

Revamping the restaurant, with the help of SMWM architects, has unleashed her creative juices. Keller fitted some of the best items on the Bizou menu, such as the tempura fried green beans ($6), into the new format. This dish is my litmus test by which all other frito misto is judged. The beans are coated in a puffy batter that crunches like corn flakes, releasing a gush of steam, yielding to tender green beans that are sweet and mild. She also kept the beef cheeks ($13) -- she was one of the first in the city to offer this once-overlooked cut of meat -- which are slowly braised to release the creamy gelatinous rivulets laced throughout the meat.

The frustrating part for the current edition is that it has performed better than its record. I'm not going to say the Browns should have beaten the Buccaneers or Romeo Crennel's Chiefs or the Ravens -- but they could have won any one of those games. They did not, though, because their record says they are a bad team, and bad teams find a way to lose.
"Every minute is important to me now, more so than ever before, because we know, sometimes you can't get anything back," says Georgette Eatmon, 54, a fourth-grade teacher at Tuscaloosa's Alberta Elementary.

It's very dangerous, probably foolhardy, to think the addition of one or two veterans is going to bring a team to the Super Bowl -- especially if the player is one who is not counted on to touch the ball more than five or six times a game. If you look at the history of veteran free agency, you could safely say only two additions have had a direct impact on a team winning a Super Bowl. Reggie White signed with the Packers in 1993, and they won it all three years later. And Drew Brees helped bring a Super Bowl to New Orleans in 2009 after signing in 2006. If any team wins a Super Bowl as the result of a 2012 addition, though, it will be the Broncos.

But it was not just law enforcement that was skeptical of Aitchison and his ilk. Many of the practicing artists in La Jolla, as well as their patrons, tended toward landscape or portrait painting.

It's a process with which the Detroit automaker is all too familiar. Ford has decommissioned 15 plants over the past decade, razing four of them itself. The company intends to hire a construction manager to oversee the demolition of the St. Paul plant, Gaudette said. It will likely bid out the job to a select group of preapproved companies it has worked with in the past, a group that includes Walbridge, the Detroit construction company that worked on Ford's Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Mich.

Of course, life has its compensations. Jake has the NFL career, but Josh got the looks and the brains. He has done some modeling (mostly print work), but that’s not in his long-term future. Indeed, when we made our final stop along our road to Super Bowl LXVI, here in the splendid suburbs of southwest Ohio, the last thing we expected to find in an NFL player’s kitchen was a textbook open to a page on hip anatomy.

"There has to be a lot of spirit, or there wouldn’t be a parade today — they wouldn’t let it die," said Joan Lightner, 74, who has attended every year for decades.
The choice of covers was clever, and revealing. "Darling Nikki" was one of the most controversial songs of the mid-’80s. Its mentions of masturbation and casual sex made it a target of parents’ groups seeking to slap warning labels on records. Prince saw lust as something natural and God-given, and challenged listeners to reject their own puritanical assumptions. On Thursday, Rihanna asked the same of her near-capacity audience.
Insurers also are testing patient-centered medical homes, a concept that's similar to accountable care organizations but focused more on individual physician practices. In these medical homes, primary-care doctors track patients between visits and act as the central point of communication between specialists, nutritionists and others. They work with a team that may include nurses and physician assistants to manage care.
Many agency managers warned workers not to try to make up lost tpay through overtime.
When Cobb and Ariadne make the tremulous and altogether familiar-sounding decision ("No!" "But I've got to!" "But it's too dangerous!" "But it's our only hope!" "OK, but I'm coming with you!") to move down into a fourth dream world, I hoped we might finally be headed for a riot of architectural invention. Instead, we get an odd, desultory cross between downtown Los Angeles circa 1965 and the urban-planning fantasies of the French Modernist architect Le Corbusier. Downtown's 1965 Department of Water and Power building, designed by AC Martin and Partners, has been stretched in Seussian fashion to become a very tall skyscraper; on the horizon, meanwhile, appear dozens if not hundreds of Corbusian, tenement-like towers.

Negatives? Well, Metro apps and the Start screen work extremely well on tablets, small notebooks, and big TVs. But Metro could probably stand some tweaks to take full advantage of desktop-sized screens. There's certainly enough pixels in a 20-inch or 24-inch display to allow two apps to run in portrait-style mode side by side without overlapping.
"We need a president who will stand up for the rights of hunters, sportsmen and those seeking to protect their homes and their families," Romney will say, according to speech excerpts released by his campaign. "President Obama has not; I will."
Then Josh devises a plan for the newly unemployed trio, plus former stockbroker and evicted Tower resident Mr. Fitzhugh (Broderick), to steal the $20 million the FBI thinks Shaw has stashed away somewhere.

Travelers are muttering to themselves, said George Hobica, the founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, which prides itself on finding low fares. "We have a price-conscious audience," he said, "and we're getting a lot of grief." The question Airfarewatchdog faces is this: Does it wait until fares come down to post something for its readers ("It may never happen," he said), or does it post these higher fares? Which, of course, is our dilemma about buying and flying. Do we wait, or do we vacate the vacation? Or is there some other strategy?

The Seaside Singers will also climb onboard the Mildred Owen Concert Hall stage to offer their voices in salute of Mother Earth. Included among their songs will be an original arrangement of Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." Twenty singers all (including bass Emmanuel Williams), the Seaside Singers are under the baton of founder and singer Judy Tugendreich. The choir got their start in Pacifica and have lived by these simple rules since day one — have a previous background of singing in a church or school choir, have a basic knowledge of how music works (notation, rhythm and so on), know how to blend your voice, have a real love of a beautiful choral sound, be willing to take on the challenge of hard work and enjoy the camaraderie that comes with all of this. Anyone who has ever heard the Seaside Singers sing, for instance at their annual Pacifica Performances "Festival of Holiday Music," their Pacifica Performances Spring Concert, or perhaps just recently at the Pacifica Pier Poetry Walk, knows this is a choral group that got their wish — lovely artistry melding in beautiful voices, plus they are a hoot!

Biden's apology followed days of frustration in the West Wing after the vice president went off script, something he had done plenty of times.

"I still remember the first time I tasted Dippin' Dots," Scott Fischer said. "As a kid who visited Six Flags Over Texas and Sea World, I had never tasted anything quite like Dippin' Dots, and it had me hooked from the first bite. As an adult, I still maintain an appreciation for the product, not only for its taste, but for its innovative character and unique status as a culinary invention.
We demand equal inclusion under the law. If our opponents’ bigotry is made plain thereby, if they meet with popular censure for preaching hate and speaking with venom, so be it, for they would rather a child have one parent — or none — than two mothers. How cruel.
Phillips said she would tell the captain to remain in his seat but simply not respond to anything, as if he were having a medical problem. Then she would see how the co-pilot handled the situation.

As a young pitcher, every pitch the power-packed Lynn throws is another video clip for the opposition to study, and the third time through the Cubs lineup Lynn found trouble.

--1B Laynce Nix went 2-for-3 with a solo home run in the Phillies' 4-0 win in Atlanta on Thursday. Nix has made six straight starts. He is batting 353 (12-for-34) with two home runs, five doubles and nine RBI in 12 starts this season. "That's usually the way it goes, if you're swinging a good bat, you get at-bats," Nix said. "I was really prepared for anything (coming into the season). I was on my toes for pinch-hit duty and part-time playing, but also making sure I was ready to play every day and produce, too."

I reached the point when I was 28 or 29 and I was in Washington, D.C., working for this VC firm, that I literally thought my career was washed up. I just thought I had made a series of wrong decisions, and I wasn't on the blueprint I thought I was going to be on. A lot of times, I think, you become an entrepreneur when you feel like you have nothing else to lose. It started to crystallize for me that my passion was creating these break-through consumer services that would change people's lives. It was later on that (venture capitalist) John Doerr and (former Electronic Arts executive) Bing Gordon, who have both been great inspirations to me, put a name on it. They called it an Internet treasure - products that people can't remember life before, or they can't imagine life without. That's what the iPhone is. That's the cellphone. That's Google. I hope it's Zynga."

I was satisfied by the chicken liver crostini ($6), which has a coarse texture so diners can enjoy little hunks of the liver. The gnocchi ($8) is among the best around; it's sauteed so that it has a crisp browned exterior and is surrounded with brown butter, fresh porcini and guanciale. Fish antipasti includes an exceptional fritto misto ($13) with shrimp, calamari, green beans and other seasonal vegetables.

Some standard cabin arrangements place the bed so close to the closet that guests had trouble accessing it.

* The editing in this episode was particularly clever; I particularly loved going from the close-up of the ratty gory remains to Nick walking into his kitchen and merrily saying,"Oooh, smoothies!"
SLUH isn't as big as it's been in the recent past. Instead, it is going with a mostly guard rotation with Daniel Schmidt (6-5) playing in the post. What SLUH lacks in athleticism it more than makes up for in poise and wits. Down 11 points midway through the third quarter, it would have been easy to let Maplewood have its way with the rest of the game and run them out of the gym. Instead the Jr. Billikens caught their breath and went back to work. It was impressive to watch.

Trying to measure the depth of this change, I visited Las Vegas for a couple of weekdays earlier this month, spoke with players, pit bosses and the experts, and was staggered by what I found.

I keep thinking about Garrett Embry, the Ducks receiver, who took a punch from Blount as he was attempting to play peacemaker. And I think about Oregon assistant Scott Frost, who grabbed Blount and wrestled him off the field like he was moving a refrigerator across a parking lot. And I keep thinking about the long line of teammates on both sides, who saw what was happening, and kept their heads.

However, he said, 56 elementary classes - about 7 percent of the total - have a few more students than the others. And whereas in the past the district might have hired teachers mid-year and split such classes into two, that will not happen this year, he said. Even the larger classes are still staffed within state guidelines, and class sizes should drop as students naturally move in and out of schools.
Clevelanders know firsthand the consequences of Washington's inability to make an infrastructure plan. The Ohio Department of Transportation has more commitments than cash. The results: broken promises, higher costs and potential safety issues.
"Frankly, I'd like to have them all paid more pay, but we have to operate within the confines with what works with taxpayers," Kasich said. "I think the bill is very fair and very balanced, and I think it is entirely appropriate for workers to be able to negotiate on wages and work rules."

A: A journal, of course. I'm not one of those people who have only one kind of journal. I have different journals, depending on where I am. The journals I take on horse retreats fit into saddle bags. The ones on river trips fit into Ziplocs. Another thing that's always in my bag is ginger chews and ginger capsules. Ginger is a great cure-all, and a wonderful way to calm a nervous stomach.

The conservative revelry is rooted in a run of elections -- in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Virginia -- in which Republicans have taken seats that Democrats had held. At the same time, Obama's agenda has bogged down in Congress, and polls and analysts suggest that a voter backlash fed by anxiety over unemployment could cost the Democrats dozens of seats in Congress, if not outright control.

No. 1 Kentucky (34-2) vs. No. 4 Indiana (27-8), 6:45 p.m., Channel 2: Indiana beat Kentucky, 73-72, on Dec. 10 on a buzzer-beating three-pointer by Christian Watford, and the Wildcats have lost once since. If Indiana is to pull the upset, it needs to make its three-pointers. The Hoosiers are second nationally in three-point percentage at 43.7; Kentucky allows foes to make 31.7% from beyond the arc. Both have excellent freshman centers in Cody Zeller (Indiana) and Anthony Davis (Kentucky), but as good as Zeller has been this season, Davis has played at a different level, especially on defense. Davis had only seven points in the first meeting, and it would seem a priority to make sure he gets touches early in this one. Indiana generally rebounds well, but can the Hoosiers keep the Wildcats off the offensive glass? Indiana's ballhandling also bears watching; the Hoosiers struggled against Virginia Commonwealth's attacking defense.
Former Davis High baseball standout Cody Keefer (inset) is continuing an impressive UCLA career. The junior is batting .365 with six doubles and 23 RBIs in 36 starts for the Bruins (27-10, 11-7 Pacific-12 Conference). Keefer is one of six players featured on the team's 2012 media guide cover.

In South Carolina, however, Gingrich won a slim majority among the 45 percent of the electorate that cited electability as the most important candidate quality in their vote.

Yes, I know. Everyone is worked up over Rizzo's base salary, which was just under $800,000, plus add-ons, which put him on track to make about $1.5 million a year. But you gotta admit, Bell got a lot of city manager for their money. If you break it down by the pound, it's not that much.

Coach Xtina spared no expense staging this number...and flew in Kimbra to duet? No, she hired a bunch of dancers to wear creepy white clown masks. And then there was more stage fog. Adam complained that he missed the power when the chorus kicks in. And that the masks creeped him out.
This morning I went into the emotional closet of my psyche and brushed past the rosy pink of contentment, the steely blue of determination and the sunny yellow of cheerfulness. Moving quickly down the rack, I paused to finger the acid green of envy and the queasy lavender of melancholia, but neither felt suitable.

Fish and Chips at Arthur Treachers, area locations: Yes, it's a chain. And yes, it was founded in the United States -- in 1969 in Columbus -- though it was named after a famous British character actor. But you'll find very good, very authentic fish and chips at these retro fast food joints. And yes, it's served in a sterile box, not an "authentic" old newspaper wrapping -- but are you going to complain about that? (Actually, it's less greasy and scaly than what I've had in London. ) A perfect start for the night at the pub, or takeout in front of the telly.
In neighboring Camas on the Columbia River, Scott Higgins leaves up a skinny picture on his online resume, but the truth is a little harder for the city's mayor. He has ratcheted up and down the scale, but on Wednesday landed at a firm 300 pounds.
Irrigation is divided into zones. Roses and vegetables near the house are watered regularly; the small orchard receives infrequent deep watering along with some ornamentals; California native plants and trees aren't irrigated at all.
But there are other concerns. Will the warm weather allow more insects to survive, meaning we, and our plants, will face more damage from their chomping this spring and summer? What about fungi and bacteria that cause plant diseases? And if we do yet get a blast of winter weather—some of the biggest snowstorms in the Northeast have come in April—could that kill tender new growth on trees and flowers in what promises to be an early spring?
The Vikings have committed the money to support a $1.1 billion stadium plan at a sprawling site in Arden Hills, which the team favors for its long-term development potential.

The city has defended the decision on multiple fronts. At first, city officials said NATO has more participants than G-8, creating bigger traffic stresses because of the greater number of motorcades stopping traffic.

I always considered this tax to be grossly regressive and another example of preferential treatment for the wealthy. The most obvious solution, one that would make the tax more fair and raise much needed revenue, is to increase or abolish the cap on contributions. Raising the eligibility age may also be necessary, but that would impose a real burden on firemen, policemen, construction workers and others who are required to have physical prowess in their professions.

Voters also should be aware that this is not the only tax increase flying at their heads. Gov. Jerry Brown is seeking a $9 billion state tax increase. President Obama wants to suspend some of the Bush tax cuts. On Jan. 1, Mr. Obama's payroll tax cut might be ended. And tax increases from Obamacare would kick in, assuming the program survives U.S. Supreme Court scrutiny.

Also, just about every computer you can buy today has built-in power management capabilities. Either you can put it to sleep, then when you want to wake it up it comes back very quickly, or you can set it to put itself to sleep after it’s been idle for, say, 15 minutes. If you don’t have your system go to sleep, or put it to sleep manually, it’s likely leaving a couple 100-watt light bulbs burning all the time, even when nobody’s around.

• Jeff Miller, OC Register: Barkley take this advice: Head to the NFL: Barkley should go to the NFL because he's projected to be a top-10 pick and, unless that changes for the worse between now and the deadline to declare for the draft, the money and opportunity before him will be too large to pass up. His senior season at USC would be a year of lost earning power, significant earning power. It would put him another year away from free agency, in an occupation where the window to make real money can close absurdly fast and with no notice.

The Jets re-signed kicker Nick Folk to a one-year deal, but they’re expected to bring in competition for him, like they did with Nick Novak last year. Punter T.J. Conley also returns, but he was inconsistent last season and could be challenged.

"There is no question that in the U.S., vegans and vegetarians are thinner and tend to be healthier than people eating the standard American diet," says Brill. However, research supports fish as a heart-healthy, low saturated fat choice, she adds. Scientists compared the health of the arteries of middle-aged Japanese men with middle-aged white American and Japanese-American men living in the U.S. The Japanese, who have a very high fish intake, had low levels of atherosclerosis and twice the amount of omega-3 fats in their blood. "The fact that the Japanese had almost no evidence of disease, yet the Japanese-Americans had high rates indicates that genetics is not a protective factor in disease risk. The researchers concluded that eating fish year in and year out protects against atherosclerosis," Brill says.

It's important to note that the differences are not absolute. Some liberals have very low dream recall, while some conservatives report very high recall.

Hey, Tony: As a long-time fan, it's painful to watch this year's version of the Browns. So, tell me if this is the reality of the situation to ease my mind: The focus this year is NOT on winning but on evaluating the current roster to establish a draft and F/A wish list at the end of the season, and for the coaches to settle in to their roles. As much as the fans want to win now, the Holmgren/Heckert regime will need a couple of years to undo the debacle of the past decade in order to form a team of solid players to fit the new offensive and defensive schemes. If this is the case, I can accept the poor performances and won't feel like I'm wasting my Sunday afternoons in a sports bar. -- Ken Knapp, Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.

As I sat on a high ledge of the 734-year-old Mingalarzedi Temple, looking out over the hundreds of ancient temples around Bagan, I wondered how long it would take a visitor to see them all. Archaeologists say there once were about 5,000 temples, but earthquakes, decay and long-ago looters have destroyed more than half of them. Still, that's a lot of temples to explore in this 16-square-mile archaeological treasure trove.

And the last 10 games, we have gotten away from that. It's not based on who's in the lineup because the same players that were in it before these guys came back, we were having the same difficulties. It's not based on personnel ... it's based on attitude."

But it was apparently too little, too late, and the Browns decided to put the saga behind them. With Hillis gone, the Browns still have running backs Montario Hardesty, Chris Ogbonnaya and Brandon Jackson on their roster.

They can also look to the second wave of free agency for a back, including former Bengals running back Cedric Benson.

The report contains several horror stories involving instructors who foist their opinions on students and it cites some tendentious course descriptions and reading lists. You don't have to be a Republican to object to a computer science instructor who calls Arnold Schwarzenegger a "Nazi actor" or a community studies teacher who (according to a student) used her course as a vehicle for a "personal vendetta against the state of Israel, against Zionism, against Israelis and against Jews." Subjecting a captive classroom audience to a one-sided political harangue is poor pedagogy, and so is stacking the deck in reading assignments.
The Brewers settled down to regain the lead the next inning.
Pittsburgh called tails for the overtime coin toss, and it came up heads. Tebow, who engineered five fourth-quarter comebacks and three OT wins in the regular season, wasted no time in finding Thomas to end the game.

It is Watson who reminds us, as he always did, that it wasn't the monograms on cigarette ash or the specialized knowledge of London's various topsoils that made Holmes such an enduring character. It was the man who delighted in disguises, who got bored and shot holes in his wall, who steadfastly admired the woman who bested him. It was never the brain, or the hat, that made the man; it was the brief but undeniable flashes of his humanity.

Bottom line: Machiavelli could learn a thing or two about divide-and-conquer from Ohio House Speaker William Batchelder, a conservative Medina Republican. The map pretty much assures that a black Democrat (Fudge or someone else) will hold Fudge's district, and that a black Democrat could win that congressional seat representing Columbus. So, of the 12 black Democrats in the Ohio House, three voted "yes" (approved the Batchelder map bill), five black Democrats noted "no" -- and four black Democrats didn't vote.

Before then, people figured a little extra weight might help withstand infectious diseases that vaccines and antibiotics later would tame. It also was a sign of prosperity. But just as doctors today bemoan a high-tech, immobile society, the emergence of trolleys, cars and other machinery in the late 19th century scaled back the sheer number of calories people once burned, Granberg explains. Increasing prosperity meant easier access to food.

Just as the poor schlump's trying to decide which nipple he's least unwilling to part with, his torturer's cell phone rings. It's Dad, back home in rustic Inishmore. Seems the torturer's cat, Wee Thomas, is doing poorly. (In actuality, though Dad's too chicken to come out and say it, the beast looks plenty dead, its brains smushed out in the middle of a road).Padraic, the torturer, turns pale. Wee Thomas, as it happens, is his best and only friend.

In fact, pretty much everyone in "Inishmore" is a nasty piece of business, although Padraic does take the cake.

Pujols' embrace of the Angels may have stunned much of the fan base he leaves behind but represented an almost predictable ending to a two-year process that began shortly after the club signed left fielder Matt Holliday to a franchise record $120 million contract in January 2010.

If you can do all of those things, you can probably score every night, but most guys don't have those tools."

Riesling and Gewurztraminer: I'm skeptical of half-sweet renditions for Thanksgiving; they seem noncommittal. Truly sweet Rieslings should cut through the meal's weight, while dry ones add a steely edge to the round contours of holiday flavors. Gewurztraminer, meantime, really should be in dry form.

Prawn coconut masala ($15) tastes almost like a Thai dish, mildly flavored with coconut, ginger, chiles, intensely reduced red onions, cashew paste and a spice blend with citric overtones that leads to a clean, refreshing finish.

It appears you purchased your policy to cover your airline ticket, through your airline's site.

In the third, with a man on third and two out, Pelfrey threw a wild pitch. And his day was done.

The French believe they have a right to pleasure and are highly tolerant of their fellow citizens' private behavior. They don't seem to mind that President Nicolas Sarkozy and his stunning pop star wife, Carla Bruni, have had affairs and they weren't too distressed when the culture minister wrote openly of patronizing young male prostitutes abroad.

In fact, male politicians are expected to exude virility as proof that they are able to handle the job. President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky was praised by even right-wing French politicians as a sign that he was a healthy male.

That said, the "stumbles and shuts off" description of your restart attempts may be a clue. The "stumble" means its got spark and some fuel. Installing a fuel pressure gauge and test driving the car until it stalls would tell you if a lack of fuel pressure is the problem. If so, try a couple of simple fixes. Carry a gallon of water in the car. and when it stalls for lack of fuel pressure, pour the water slowly over the fuel rail, pressure regulator and intake manifold to cool them. If the engine restarts and runs, it could be vapor lock -- fuel boiling in the fuel rail causing a loss of fuel pressure.

While the 40-year-old Mr. Abramovich now spends much of his time in London, he and other oligarchs are seen as symbols of a new Russian system that places huge riches in the hands of a few.

Should he have been forced to serve time in jail? It's hard to see what purpose that would serve. Mr. Schurick, who had a long and prominent career in Maryland politics and government before this incident, is no threat to society.

Bahr skillfully portrays the tough, unsentimental facade that is Anita's response to a life of hardships, but she also lets us see the vulnerable, caring heart that lies beneath this brittle surface.

Nonetheless, Bahr's Anita is not lacking in sympathy for this haunted visitor.
